0,0,5mL_LAuuq6A,"(gentle music) (gentle upbeat music) (rhythmic upbeat music) - What's up guys, Saf here on SuperSaf TV, and in this video, we're going
to be doing a detailed comparison between the OnePlus 8 Pro and
the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. We've got the best from OnePlus, as well as the best from Samsung. We'll compare all of the key differences, as well as some image
samples SuperSaf style. So, let's initially look
at the built and design. Now, both devices are very premium. We've got a metal frame
with curved glass bowls on the front and the
back, and both devices are also IP 68 water and dust resistant. The S20 Ultra does however
only come in two options, and they are both glossy. We've got a cosmic
black and a cosmic gray, which we see here. So, it's pretty plain and we also have this pretty large
rectangular camera module. The OnePlus 8 Pro comes
in this frosted finish of this glacial green, which we have here. There's also a glossy onyx black, as well as an ultramarine blue, which is currently not
available in the UK. The camera module is central lined. Now, looking at these both side by side, I would have to say that the OnePlus 8 Pro does have a better design in my opinion. I do like the central line camera module, which makes things symmetrical. I also really like this
frosted matte glass finish, which attracts less fingerprints and it also has this really cool effect, depending on the way the light hits it. Now, in either case you can customize the look of these devices with a skin from our channels sponsor dbrand, they've got a huge variety and you can swap things around once you get too bored as well. My personal favorite now is the teardown series which is made in partnership with my good friend Zack from JerryRigEverything. If you're interested in picking up a skin, then there's going to be a
link in the description below. Now, I'm looking at the differences in terms of the size. Both are large devices, but the S20 Ultra is slightly larger in the height, the width,
as well as the thickness. It's also around 20, 21 grams heavier. But both devices are large and that's because they
have large displays. Now, both displays are
really, really good. These are some of the best
displays out there right now. We've got minimal bezels with a punch-out. Now, I would say that the S20 Ultra does have a slightly
smaller bezel on the top, but they're very, very similar. Both displays also curve from the sides. However, the OnePlus 8
Pro is a bit more curved on the sides in comparison
to the S20 Ultra. Now, the OnePlus 8 Pro
has a 6.78 inch display. The S20 Ultra has a slightly
larger 6.9 inch display. Both of these are using AMOLED technology. Both have up to a Quad HD+ resolution and both also supports
a 120 Hertz refresh rate with 240 Hertz of touch input. But, there is a little bit of a catch. On the S20 Ultra you can only have the 120 Hertz refresh rate. If you're at Full HD you
cannot have this at Quad HD. Now, this seems to be
to save on battery life, but on the OnePlus 8 Pro
you do have that option. So, if you do want to go all out and absolutely kill your battery, you can do that. And I like that this option is here, because maybe you do want
that very high resolution, as well as that high refresh rate, and this is an advantage
that the OnePlus 8 Pro has. The OnePlus 8 Pro also
has MEMC technology, so that's motion estimation
and motion compensation. This is essentially going to take content that's at a standard prime
rate, say 25, 30 frames a second and make it seem as though
it's at a higher frame rate by applying motion smoothness
and things like that. This is something that
you may, or may not like. It is supported across
lots of popular apps, such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, as well as YouTube. Now, generally speaking
I don't think you can go wrong with either of these displays, they are some of the
best displays out there. The OnePlus 8 Pro you are
getting that advantage of Quad HD+ with a 120 Hertz. On the S20 Ultra you're getting a center punch-out, which
I do personally prefer a little bit to the side punch-out here on the OnePlus 8 Pro. And the display is also
a little bit flatter, compared to the very curved
display of the OnePlus 8 Pro. Now, another thing is that the S20 Ultra does have an Always-On Display, which is something that I
personally find really useful. You can just see things at a glance. The OnePlus 8 Pro unfortunately
still does not have this. I'm sure it can come
with a software update, but currently and its state right now it is not there unfortunately. Now, both devices do have an
in-display fingerprint scanner, which is very, very, fast. However, the technology
is quite different. The OnePlus 8 Pro has an optical in-display fingerprint scanner. The S20 Ultra has an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner. So, the technology is
superior on the S20 Ultra. It is actually measuring
the ridges in your fingers. However, the OnePlus 8 Pro can be a little bit faster I have found. Now, one thing that I don't
like on the OnePlus 8 Pro is that you do have to wake
the device before you can use the fingerprint scanner. So, there is an extra step involved. You have to either tap to
wake it, then press it, or lift the device to wake it. Whereas on the S20 Ultra it is always on and you can just tap in this area whenever and it's going
to unlock your device. So, I know a lot of people
do praise OnePlus devices for the fingerprint
scanner and how fast it is, but for me that extra step
actually makes it slower. So I do personally prefer
the ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner on the S20 Ultra. Now, let's talk about the cameras. We'll start with the front-facing cameras. You can see here that we
do have the punch-outs. The S20 Ultra does have a high resolution, as well as a wider aperture. And you can see some samples here. I think both of them do a
pretty good job overall. I do find that the OnePlus 8 Pro does still overexpose for selfies. This is something that I've noticed on previous OnePlus devices as well. It does make you look a little bit fairer, compared to how you actually are. The S20 Ultra, although it's
not my favorite selfie camera and it can still lighten your skin a little bit. I would still prefer it overall to the OnePlus 8 Pro. And also for video, because the OnePlus 8 Pro can only film at 180p from the front-facing camera at 30 frames a second. The S20 Ultra can film
at up to 4K, 60 frames a second from the front-facing camera. So, for those reasons the
edge does go to the S20 Ultra for the front-facing camera, but things are quite interesting when we look at the rear-facing cameras. So, we do have a Quad camera setup on both of these. The three main cameras are similar in the sense that we've
got an ultra-wide camera, we've got a primary camera and then we've got a telephoto camera, which is going to give optical zoom. The fourth camera is different. The S20 Ultra has a Time of Flight sensor, which is going to help
with depth information. The OnePlus 8 Pro has
a color filer camera, which I'm still a little
bit confused about. I'm not sure what the
exact use of this is, because as far as I can
see a lot of the filters that you get on there
you can actually apply in a post anyway, but
nevertheless it's there. Now, you can see a few samples here, the primary cameras
I'd say are very good on both for most situations. They do have good dynamic
range overall and good colors. For the ultra-wide cameras
I think both do a good job. The S20 Ultra is slightly wider, which I do prefer. And for the telephoto cameras the S20 Ultra does have
much more optical zoom. So you can get in much
closer to you subjects and this is a lot more noticeable when you go to the likes
of 10 times up to 30 times. Now, I know it does seem 100X here on the S20 Ultra, but you guys probably already know how I feel about this. It's not really practical, it's not really usable. I'm not sure why Samsung
have plastered 100X on here when it is at this level. It's fine to have and
you don't need to use it, but Samsung don't plaster
it on the freaking device. Now, for low light it
was quite interesting, because in certain situations
I did prefer the S20 Ultra, in certain situations I
preferred the OnePlus 8 Pro. Here you can see an outdoor shot. The S20 Ultra for me is a lot better, there's a lot of processing happening on the OnePlus 8 Pro's shot. But, on this indoor shot I
did prefer the OnePlus 8 Pro which did better maintain
the colors and the detail compared to the S20 Ultra. The OnePlus 8 Pro also has a macro mode which lets you get in super up-close using the ultra-wide camera. This is something you don't
have on the S20 Ultra. Now, for video both did
seem to do a good job. One area where the OnePlus
8 Pro is definitely better is in autofocus. This is something that the
Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra has struggle with, even
after numerous updates. It just doesn't have that
dual pixel autofocus, which Samsung has been known for, for a long time and it can struggle a lot of times with focus. The OnePlus 8 Pro is definitely
faster and better here. And rear-facing cameras. We can switch to ultra-wide on both. And we can also zoom. It's three times on the OnePlus 8 Pro and there's five times on the S20 Ultra. The S20 Ultra however does offer 8K video. Now, this is a great add. It does crop in quite heavily and you do lose some
stabilization and things, but it's definitely a nice option to have if you do want to play around with it. This is something that's not
available on the OnePlus 8 Pro. Now, of course this is not a detailed SuperSaf style camera comparison. I just wanted to show you a
few image and video samples. I will hopefully do some
more in detail camera test when the lockdown is over. Right now I can pretty much just shoot in and around my house,
which is quite limiting. Now, let's talk about the performance. So the OnePlus 8 Pro,
it is all about speed. It does come with the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 865 chip set, along with the X55 modem for 5G. The S20 Ultra it comes in two options. So, you guys may already know about this, but depending on your region
you're going to get either the same, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, or you might get the Exynos 990. Now, you may have seen
loads of YouTubers talk about this, including myself. The Exynos chip set
unfortunately is just not as good as the 865 when it comes to performance, but more so when it comes
to power efficiency. The 865 is just better in my experience. Unfortunately you don't
have a choice about this. So, depending on your
region the OnePlus 8 Pro might actually be the faster devices, or it might be quite equal. This is something that,
you know, hopefully Samsung will improve over time and
have some more consistency. I just like if they
went all out on the 865, but hey, let's see. For storage you do have a base
of 128 gigabytes, UFS 3.0. The S20 Ultra is available
in a 512 gigabyte version. The OnePlus 8 Pro is also
available in a 256 byte option. For RAM the S20 Ultra does come with more RAM straight off the back. So, you've got 12
gigabytes of RAM as a base, you've got up to 16 gigabytes. The OnePlus 8 Pro comes in either eight, or 12 gigabytes of RAM. And now in speed and
performance generally speaking, both of these are going
to be really, really good. The S20 Ultra does get one advantage and that is that it does
have a micro SD card slot, so you can expand the storage
here on the S20 Ultra. You cannot expand the
storage on the OnePlus 8 Pro. The OnePlus 8 Pro also comes as default with dual SIM functionality,
so that's great. The S20 Ultra, again,
this is going to vary depending on your region. Some regions do have
dual SIM, others do not. Now, let's talk about the software. So both devices do have
Android 10 out of the box, and they come with their own skins. So, on the OnePlus 8
Pro we do have OxygenOS. The S20 Ultra comes with OneUI. Now, realistically speaking these are some of my favorite skins. They are my top two, they're
very clean, very functional and they also do add
features that you don't get as defaults on stock Android. So, I'm very happy with both of these. A lot of it is going to come
down to your personal preference. One advantage that I have
to give to the OnePlus 8 Pro is that OnePlus is really,
really good with updates. They do generally provide
updates much faster than the likes of Samsung,
as well as many others. So, if updates are important to you then the OnePlus 8 Pro is going
to be a great option. Now, for speakers both devices
do have stereo speakers. We've got one bottom-firing and then we've got one in the earpiece. Both sound really, really good. And now let's talk about the batteries. So the S20 Ultra does
have a larger battery, and in my usage it's been really good. However, this is once again going
to come down to your region. The Exynos version is
not as power efficient, which means I'm getting
around 20% less battery life on my Exynos version, compared to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865. And I am generally getting over six hours of screen-on time on a regular basis. So, I've been very, very
happy with the S20 Ultra. Now, bear in mind this is
Full HD+ at a 120 Hertz, with the Qualcomm version. I've not have the OnePlus
8 Pro long enough as yet to give you a proper
conclusion of battery life. Generally speaking it has
been pretty good for me and does get me through the day. For charging, both of these
do support very fast charging out of the box, however you do
get a slightly faster charger with the OnePlus 8 Pro,
compared to the S20 Ultra. However, you can buy a 45
Watt charger separately, which is going to charge up
the S20 Ultra very, very fast. And the OnePlus 8 Pro for the first time on a OnePlus device does
have wireless charging. This is something that
I've been asking for, for a very, very long time. And not only that, it's
also very, very fast compared to the S20 Ultra. The S20 Ultra is around 15
Watts and the OnePlus 8 Pro is going towards 30 Watts. So, you're getting from one
to 50% in just 30 minutes. This is wireless charging,
so it's something that I'm very, very happy to
see here on the OnePlus 8 Pro. And both devices do support
reverse wireless charging. So, this is where you can use the devices to charge, maybe some accessories
or something wirelessly. Now, the S20 Ultra here
does get the advantage, because it does have faster
reverse wireless charging, compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro. The OnePlus 8 Pro also has a new feature, which OnePlus have introduced and that is smart charging optimization, which is supposed to give your battery a longer lifespan overtime. And what this essentially does is it delays your charging
based on you usage pattern. So, say for instance you wake
up at 8:00 a.m. every day, then it's not going to charge your device to really 100% until you wake up. and this way it should help your battery health in the long term. Now, let's talk about the price. The OnePlus 8 Pro has gone up in price, compared to the previous generation, something we've been seeing from OnePlus year and year again. So it is starting at around $900. The S20 Ultra however
does start much higher at around $1400, or around
1200 pounds here in the UK. So you are going to be
paying quite a bit more for the S20 Ultra compared
to the OnePlus 8 Pro. And the OnePlus 8 Pro, let's be real, is the better overall deal here. You are getting a lot of
features for that price. The S20 Ultra is a really good device and it is offering some unique features such as that extensive zoom, but is it worth that higher price tag? What do you guys think? Definitely let me know
in the comments below. Also let me know which device
you would pick overall, the OnePlus 8 Pro or the S20
Ultra Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. If you want to see lots more content here on the channel like this, then be sure to subscribe

1,1,LTDuGU38-70,[Music] hey what's up guys I'm Kip EHD here we're back and yeah you got me I've been using the oneplus 8 pro daily for about two weeks now and I gotta say they did it they finally did it they just went ahead and made a flagship like a bonafide complete feelin flagship phone finally now there are still a few snags and I will nitpick about those because that's what you do in a phone that starts now at nine hundred bucks but still nevertheless really happy to see them finally commit to something like this and it's been a long time coming so today as you may have seen one plus launched their newest highest end phone it's the oneplus 8 pro taking yet another step up in the ladder of their phones getting slightly more expensive every year but alongside it they also dropped the one plus eight which is sort of more like a premium mid-range phone that starts at $6.99 so that that will be its own separate video that'll come out later once I fully daily drive this phone switched to it give it that treatment that's gonna be a tough video to make without all kinds of reflections but definitely subscribe to see that video first when it comes out hit the red button below if you haven't already that's coming up but until then we're talking about this guy the eight pro the flagship so the bleeding edge high-end specs shouldn't be a surprise when we see a new one plus phone I mean beside the fact that they slowly tease out all the specs the weeks leading up to the phone's launch it's kind of what they are known for you know placing what feels like the highest and best available specs for the highest and performance all-in-one phone and we still have a very familiar oneplus design and experience here to they still have their logo on the back and still things like the alert slider that I'm surprised more phones haven't copied yet still oxygen OS one of my favorite clean Android skins with all of its features oh wait stop plus what if the nitpicks always been with oneplus phones one is that their cameras are always just not quite measuring up to the flagships and to that they always tend to leave out these sort of fringe features that don't feel essential but still feel like you should have them if you're gonna claim that you're a flagship things like wireless charging and ip68 certification well guess what they finally went added this year an improved camera wireless charging and an official ip68 water and dust resistance rating finally but you know what let me start from the top with a new design for the 1 plus 8 Pro you can see it here I really like a lot of it the new matte finish and this blue color are pretty sick I don't have a lot of matte blue phones but this one is nice it's punchy and clean so it's easily my favorite blue phone and this finish is nice it doesn't really show too many fingerprints of course you can also grab this ultra matte teardown skin from our channel sponsor D brand which also feels great and you can see the wireless charging coil in the back plus it's also got a few Easter eggs hidden in the design which are pretty dope but anyway yeah the shape of the phone is boxy which I've always really liked plus there's this new little design accent Ridge into the top of the phone so generally I think it's one of the absolute better-looking phones out there but I still get to nitpick because like I said a $900 phone that's what's gonna happen this camera bumped well it's not as ugly as some of the others out there it still is pretty big like it's annoyingly rocks on a table big for sticking out of the phone that much so I got to point that out but again you can put a case on it and get rid of that then you get a round to the front and you're looking at the new display which is an upgrade to pretty much all the ways that count but also technically technically a slight downgrade to so this is a six point seven eight inch 1440p 120 Hertz AMOLED display and it's really really good one plus and display mates say it's their most color accurate display ever you know the best a plus they've ever given etc etc they're kind of starting to sound a lot like the XO mark at this point look I believe you the color is great the calibration is great but what I notice more often is number one it's definitely a lot brighter than last year which is sweet and then of course the flagship feature for 2024 all these new flagships which is the smooth 120 Hertz refresh rate plus 240 Hertz touch sampling rate and it is awesome I've been looking forward to this couple specifics on it one yes it does let you run both high refresh rate and high resolution at the same time and that's exactly what I've been doing 1440p at hundred twenty Hertz at the expense of battery but you know live your life then yes it is technically a variable refresh rate so even when you have it set to 120 Hertz just like last year it will step down to sixty Hertz occasionally when you're just sitting around not doing anything or if you're on a home screen or if you're in some app that won't use that like Waze or Google Maps or snapchat or a game or something then yes there is still an optical fingerprint reader underneath that screen it doesn't appear to be any bigger or faster but still fairly reliable for me and yes the edges are still curved over both sides and this is my least favorite feature of this display I still get accidental touches like really I I realized the idea is it looks cool and it's edgeless and futuristic but I think it's time to slow that down and I think Samsung's perfected that balance this year between curving the glass a little bit and still having a flat working surface with no accidental touches so just saying and also by now from all these Beauty angles of the screen certainly you've noticed that hole-punch camera in the top left corner for the selfie shooter for the 1+8 pro hot take the pop-up camera was the pop up camera was better than the hole punch and this is a downgrade like I get that the pop up camera was a moving part I was the first to point that out a moving part and a phone is always a part to pay attention to but we haven't had any durability problems with them for the past two years we've seen them in phones and of course having that part hidden inside allows you a fully uninterrupted screen with no hole punch and when it closes down into the phone and you're not using it it's blocked by the rest of the phone so that's an added security benefit so seems like the pop up camera was the way to go so why do they remove the pop up camera and change back to a hole punch I don't know maybe to look a little bit more like the other flagships maybe to save a little bit of money maybe maybe to guarantee the ip68 water certification maybe just a little bit of all these things also side note I would like to see some of these phones offering 120 Hertz screens also offer a 90 Hertz mode in between 60 and 120 so we really know we can step down to 1080p to save battery life I think it would be nice to be able to step down 90 Hertz to save battery life - just a an idea some of the gaming phones have done this already but I want to see more flagships doing it - so there's a free idea so all of the 1+8 internal specs are high-end top-end you know snapdragon 865 eight or twelve gigs of fast lpddr4 am it's that super fast ufs 3.0 storage and the battery also gets an upgrade because on top of all that it's a 5g capable phone with 120 Hertz big display so you get a four thousand five hundred ten milliamp hour battery it's not the biggest battery in the world but for me it did just fine like I said I've been using the phone with my high brightness high GPS use at 1440p 120 Hertz and I've been getting to the end of the day pretty comfortably I could kill this phone in a day and I've noticed that but if I didn't want to I would step down to 1080p and I would say have a lot of pixel pushing and a lot of battery and that's a nice backup to have generally for me I'm talking about like a six hour screen on time for this phone six and a half hours if you want to reference back to other videos that's really good but also something to note is for me the charging habits of your phone can change what you think of the battery and oneplus phones are known for having fast charging this one's no exception you still have their high speed warp charge 30t comes in the box and that can get you from 0 to half battery in like 25 minutes but what's new to this phone is wireless charging finally oneplus is putting the little charging coil behind the glass back and enabling wireless charging and on top of all that even better it's fast wireless charging so 30 watt wireless charging is what they're claiming and sharing with everyone which is really nice that's fast that's gonna top up from 0 to half battery in half an hour but there's a catch you only get fast 30 watt wireless charging with this phone with this exact brand new $70 oneplus wireless charging stand you need this accessory to get 30 watts wireless charging on the spot and that's because it is not 30 watts of purely qi wireless charging so oneplus has worked on this special high-end why charging tech and to be fair it works exactly as advertised the stand is nice it has some little quiet fans in there and it does some special voltage and thermal management to get the peak 30 watts wireless charging out of it but if you put another Qi enabled phone on that wireless charger it charges slower and if you put the 1+8 pro on any other qi wireless charger it charges slower because that tech was proprietary so the oneplus 8 pro still supports regular qi wireless charging but only universally at five watts which is pretty slow it's not it's I mean it works but it's like it's pretty slow so for me I'm not gonna replace that you can't see it but I'm not gonna replace the wireless charger at my desk with the oneplus one because I have other Qi accessories like my ear pods Pro or my iPhone or literally any other Qi phone that I want to charge faster wirelessly so I'm just gonna stick to Wired warp charging in the car and pretty much everywhere I need it but at home I have a pixel stand at my desk and I can just leave it there to slowly top-up over night and wake up with a hundred percent so I'm glad to have wireless charging but there is that little snag so then there are the cameras quad cameras on the back of this phone and here are the numbers which maybe mean less than ever these days but it's a new forty eight megapixel main camera with oh is then there's a forty eight megapixel ultra wide with macro mode which fun fact is the same sensor as the primary camera from the oneplus 7 pro then there's a 3x telephoto camera and believe it or not the fourth one is a five megapixel color filter camera so that's your array and I'll just go ahead and say it the oneplus 8 pro is a flagship quality camera right in line with galaxy s 20 and Huawei P 40 and just short of the pixel and the iPhone there I said it it's spitting out sharp 12 megapixel images with nice dynamic range and colors a bit overexposed sometimes that's where it misses but generally these are nice photos also sorry in advance for slightly less outdoor photos the whole shelter-in-place Quarantine thing clearly means I also have less people subjects but yeah you can tell this is an confid nice camera no autofocus issues at all especially when you give it some light and even sometimes when you don't it's nice I like it you are still gonna get more fringing with close-up subjects I take a lot of close-ups subject photos and that's the downside of a big one over 1.4 inch sensor but again that just seems like par for the course for flagship cameras right now big sensor usually sharp photos but get some fringing when your photos are close-up subjects the night mode is pretty good which is nice max zoom is 30 X from that telephoto camera I don't think it's very usable at 30 X it's barely passable galaxy s 20 Ultra is still gonna be the zoom champ for that sort of range but tight 10x is fine and 3x is definitely usable and I have pretty much no use for the head color filter camera the selfie camera you guys have asked for it I usually don't get too into the selfie camera in smartphones but I'll do it I'll start taking selfies now it's part of the job and I gotta say this one still seems to struggle with proper exposure and maybe that's gonna happen more for people with darker skin like myself but other than that it's still looking pretty good with detail and video from this camera is also good especially with color and stabilization at 4k and you can see no 8k video here but you know you're not touching the iPhone when it comes to the absolute best video quality in a phone right now but this is still good flagship quality color me impressed I think god I think some people took me saying that the camera was the worst part of the phone last year as like some sort of horrific flaw in it when really it was like the rest of the phone was so incredibly good that feat ok camera was the downside but again now we're looking at a flagship quality camera and they've also been notoriously pretty good with updating them over time and getting better with camera quality that's been nice plus they're probably a G cam mod in the next couple weeks hopefully if you want those sweet pixel contrast II photos so yeah thumbs up on the camera and then one plus phones have long been some of my favorites specifically because of the software and optimized experience this is oxygen OS on top of Android 10 and that's no exception here for this phone there's tons of little tweaks and optimizations and provements and little tightened up animations all over the place but it never feels overloaded like some other overlays actually removed the oxygen OS shelf to the left of the home screen and it's just Google's Discoverer page now like a pixel and there's really high quality haptics in this phone again I love that and then in software there's just a couple new software features here and there that are nicely executed there's a new dark mode 2.0 theme some new dynamic wallpapers tucked in there and just a lot of aesthetic tweaks generally but they do a good job of not feeling overly cartoony and then there's a new motion graphic smoothing toggle that works with certain apps you can see the whole compatibility list here from my phone and it worked pretty well when I tried it for like two minutes but I feel like I'm against motion smoothing like on principle at my core so I turned that off pretty quick but you might remember that what's on my phone video with the galaxy s 20 where I go through all the things that I do that the little subtle software tweaks to really make it my daily driver and make it behave the way I want that list of things is so much shorter on a phone like the oneplus 8 pro or a pixel and I yeah this this is gonna be my new daily driver so long story short they finally made a flagship they finally did it they're charging flagship money and they're offering pretty much everything a flagship would in a bonafide complete kind of predictable feeling way but still it's what we're looking forward to matter of fact let me put my predictions down for the one plus eight T pro that'll probably come out in like six to eight months you're probably looking at snapdragon 865 plus maybe a little extra RAM probably faster charging faster qi wireless charging I also think maybe they could use a little bit of a darker coating on the selfie camera up in the corner and maybe a special McLaren Edition phone and that's it but in the meantime this becomes one of the easiest phones to recommend period even though it's the most expensive one plus phone ever which is a nice headline to write it still undercuts a lot of the other flagships

2,2,MHWnTJwxsKM,oK you've seen the title these are the two highest end 2020 flag ships from 1 plus and samsung I've used both for a fair bit of time now and today we're going to declare a Android smartphone king also alongside this video I've launched another one comparing the normal 1 plus 8 with Apple's iPhone 11 because that phone was basically built to be an iPhone killer so after you've seen this one then do check that one out too in case you're wondering this is the package oneplus sent out to me it's the media kit which has a few cool things inside for starters a beefy reviewers guide I'm talking a 60 page read over here and 2 official cases one is the sunstone bumper which I mean it feels ok solid all run protection with a textured finish on both the outside and inside but it is just a sheet of plastic the second though is the carbon bumper which i think is slightly nicer it's part TPU and pot' Kevlar it still feels slim and light but does have a nice matte finish on the outside texture on the inside and finally this is the retail box the phone so if you hopped into a store right now well this is the box you'd get and I would go as far as to say that the combination of what it looks like and what you get in here makes this one of my favorite boxes and ever the phone is on top and below that you get this elongated insert which has a couple of cool things inside some information cards a sheet of oneplus stickers and the invitation letter which has the similar typical attached on to it this is just basically one plus saying hi there yeah thanks for buying me there's more though I'm a big fan of this case they've added in there it's not just some lazy generic TPU sheet it's got the never settle slogan in Vic text it's got a matte finish on the rails texture on the inside and a little designed by 1 plus text there's a USBC cable for charging and a 30 watt warp charger this is fast the eagle-eyed among you might have noticed that oneplus is actually branded since their last phone everything is now in all caps with a slightly bolder logo anyways holding these two phones together you'll notice something the oneplus 8 pro is a big phone but Samsung is a slightly bigger in every dimension you'll almost miss it at a glance but because it's bigger from all angles it's taller thicker heavier wider and so when you add all those together this feels like a middleweight versus heavy weight situation like no one ever wants to drop their phone on their face when they're scrolling embedded right but I get the feeling that if you did do that with this phone you'd be out for a few days and as a result almost by default oneplus is the more ergonomic palm friendly offering but on top of that it's smaller dimensions are combined with a slightly curved back and a matte finish if you go for the top-end model this I'm phone off in the UK at least the two color options you get are glossy black and this greeny blue color bordering on being a little plain for still it's done well and some color is still better than no color like the Samsung which comes in either black or this exciting gray color oh yeah and neither phone has a headphone jack but oneplus does have a dedicated slider for switching between ring vibrate and silent the only real design negative for oneplus is the enormous camera bump it was pretty much my first observation when I took the phone out the box but let's not forget Samsung sticks out just as much but it's wider too if you're going to use a case neither of these is a big deal because they'll even out the back but if you're going there the protrusions on either side are enough that you can't really use these phones sitting on a flat surface okay anyways the traditional oneplus smartphone strategy has always been to cut a few corners to make a firm that is nearly as good as the top level flagship ferns but much cheaper that's changing this time round the oneplus 8 pro is edging ever closer to costing as much as a flagship I'll come to this but now with little if any compromise for example past oneplus phones they skipped an IP rating they skipped wireless charging but now you've got both and in fact one plus wireless charging has gone from being non-existent to now actually a head of Samsung's it can charge with 30 watts of power versus 15 on the ultra and displays Samsung really is the one to beat when it comes to smartphone screens but for my preferences at least I would go as far as to say that oneplus has actually just done that they're similar screens both friends actually use a display made by Samsung they both have insanely high quad HD plus resolutions AMOLED technology for deep contrast 120 Hertz refresh rates for liquid smooth performance and built in technologies to reduce the amount of blue light emitted which is just better for your sleep cycle a similar size to is six point seven eight inches versus six point 9 inches but a few differences and the key one for me actually being brightness I always couldn't believe it the one plus looks significantly brighter than Samsung's I've tried indoor I've tried out door the same result we're talking a screen so bright that sometimes I would find myself not bothering to use the torch but instead of just turning my phone around and using the display oh yeah and one plus can keep running a quad HD plus resolution whilst having it's 120 Hertz refresh rate on with Samsung it's a case of deciding do I want an ultra sharp display or do I want an ultra smooth display and on top of that yes there is more want less claims they further extend their lead with something called M EMC technology it's a piece of software that tries to combat the fact that we've got displays here that refresh 120 times per second and yet most videos are filmed at 24 or 30 so when you're using certain apps like YouTube on this version it can actually insert extra frames to make the video appear smoother but after a bit I turn the feature off it causes extra battery drain and to be honest while it does look beautiful on videos that are already filmed at say 60 frames per second what is trying to upscale videos that are filmed at like 24 or 30 the end results framerate is kind of all over the place it kind of judders both phones have an almost identically sized hole punch do you want it on the side or do you want it in the middle it is completely up to you me personally I'm a corner hole kind of guy you lose symmetry but it means that when you watch videos the hole punch kind of disappears generally when you're watching something your eyes are kind of focused on the center of your screen so if you have a corner hole punch it's kind of further into your peripheral vision the last thing I did notice is the extra curve you get on the 8 pro's display which for the most part is just a subjective thing but I will say that it's just enough of a curve that in some rare cases when I was holding the phone with one hand my other fingers would be triggering the edges and this doesn't seem to happen on the Samsung and one thing I've really got a hand to Samsung is the fact that in the last few years they've brought their phones up from being some of the more bloated and sluggish offerings to actually some of the snappiest 1 plus used to have a very clear speed and actually even battery advantage but I think it's starting to fade and let me be very clear this is not a case of one-plus getting slower by any stretch of the imagination v8 Pro is blistering fast it's just a case that actually Samsung has caught and we're at a stage where I really can't tell much of a difference between them anymore both phones have those ultra fluid 120 Hertz displays and pretty much the best specs you can hope for top-end chipsets a ton of RAM up to 12 gigs on oneplus and 16 on Samsung and fast u FS 3.0 storage the only caveat with the Samsung is and we've gone through this is the fact that there's two different versions of the phone depending on which region you're in and long story short if you get the Snapdragon version in your region you get to go this is a really fantastically performing phone but if you get the Exynos version and not so much but the full detail is linked somewhere here so you can check that up I guess the point here is that no matter what region you're in with the oneplus you'll get the better Snapdragon chip even the speakers on the oneplus a top level this is another corner the company has historically cut but not anymore you get one on the front on bottom vocals and instrumentals just sounded so crisp and I would say the volume is comparable between the two so at this stage it's starting to seem a little bit like a homerun for one plus it seems as if it does pretty much everything the s20 ultra does but just at least as good or better and it's far cheaper so does the s20 ultra even have a place well the one area where I can see oneplus two saved some money versus Samsung is the camera system and so while Samsung has a massive 108 megapixel main sensor oneplus has a smaller 48 megapixel one it's a new sensor it's an improvement from last gen but not as good as Samsung's something has a high-resolution telephoto camera that you do 10 times hybrid zoom what Plus can do three times hybrid zoom and they both have pretty comparable ultra white cameras but this is where it gets weird these are both quad camera systems Samsung's forth is a time-of-flight camera to detect depth but oneplus is fourth is something called a color filter camera or in other words a camera that can view the world in a slightly different way and I'll give it this it has been fun walking around and just seeing how different normal day-to-day objects look but honestly I have really tried to give this thing a chance and I just don't get it it doesn't make any sense to me the camera is low resolution and it doesn't let nearly as much light in as your main camera in a best-case scenario your outputs gonna look like a really old film and in worst case it'll just look like something's gone wrong maybe someone will really cool views for it but considering that in my briefing of the phone the company barely touched on it and considering that the setting for using this camera is hidden away in the filters menu it suggests that oneplus isn't that confident in it either that said I spent most of my time with oneplus camera actually just being taken aback at how much they've improved the rest of it it may be cheaper hardware than what's on Samsung's but in almost every situation the output is at least as good Paswan plus phones had some potentially wonky color processing none of that here photos look true to life and crispy with nice depth of field thanks to a pretty large sensor and video the video colors and the dynamic range are stunning and lifelike it feels like oneplus has gone right back to the drawing board and built a completely new color processing algorithm that just works monie current gripe is that while yes that dynamic range is gorgeous the focusing is not or at least it isn't yet and funnily enough it just so happens that this is also an issue for Samsung but detail camera comparison coming very soon so if you could subscribe to that that would be amazing a few final things to note both have in display fingerprint scanners and dual SIM functionality but with the Samsung you can actually use one of those SIM card slots to double as extra expandable storage I also slightly prefer the haptic engine on the ultra but you get good general vibration feedback on both and in terms of charging speeds you won't have a problem whichever way you turn here the crucial factor here though is that it just so happens that Samsung's high-end is 50% more expensive than one pluses high-end you are getting a more impressive spec sheet with the Samsung you're getting those extreme numbers that you're paying for things like a 100 an 8 megapixel camera versus 48 a five thousand milliamp hour battery versus 4510 on one plus 16 gigs of ram versus 12 and so on but from my time with it these extreme specifications don't really translate to an extreme experience in its defense I think the s20 ultra gets more flack than it deserves this is a beastly phone providing you get the Snapdragon version but I really think the only people it applies to are people who are really interested in the galaxy s xx but who are willing to pay more the ultra looks really impressive next to Samsung's own lineup where you can see side-by-side each extra thing you're getting for your money that extra Ram that bigger back three that further zoom on your camera it seems worth it but when you kind of take the Galaxy S 20 ultra out of that context when you pitch it against aggressively price competition like this I think the value proposition of the phone crumbles and so I think it's pretty clear between the two one plus wins you don't forget to check out the video I made on the oneplus 8 vs iPhone 11 I think it's really interesting and without being said my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you

in the next one [Music],0.0,7.0
3,3,OHP1rLwR6r8,hey what's up guys mkbhd here and this this is one plus eight now oneplus didn't just also come out with a one plus eight pro this is the phone one plus would mark it as flagship killer right but we all see oneplus slowly moving away from that direction now they have a different slogan fast and smooth and you can tell they're getting away from the flagship killer thing now that they actually make a flagship but this is exactly what I'd expect from the oneplus that I feel like we've always known so this interstellar glow one plus eight star set $6.99 and it has the bleeding edge high-end specs you'd want for fast performance snapdragon 865 with the 5g modems in there eight or twelve gigs of fast Ram ufs 3.0 storage Wi-Fi six like that's all nice it's a fast phone definitely love that but there are a few things here cut down to save cost and I'll compare this a lot to the 1+8 pro so if you haven't watched that it's the previous video firstly pull the like button if you want to watch it to catch up that's there but the story is if you work for one plus and you started off with this nine hundred two thousand dollar phone and you're like alright what are we gonna cut out of this phone to get the price way down but still give people a pretty close to a flagship experience what would we do well this is what they did first of all its overall a bit of a smaller form factor now it's by no means a small phone it's definitely still big it has a six point five five inch display which makes it still a little taller than the iPhone 11 pro max so it's not small but it is a little bit smaller than the eight pro and it's also definitely lighter it's noticeably lighter to me it's 180 grams on paper to be exact and to me it feels comfortable in the hand then there's that display it still has the optical fingerprint reader underneath it's still HDR 10 plus certified and still super color accurate and much brighter than last year which is key so it's super visible outdoors but now it's 1080p resolution instead of 1440 that's a smart move that they've done in the past and it's also now high refresh rate at 90 Hertz instead of 120 Hertz I'd love to get blind tested on this but I've said I can personally see the difference between 90 and 120 Hertz but it's small and you have to be looking for it but I'll definitely prefer either of those two 60 Hertz because that difference is visually huge so this is still high refresh rate so this is a cost-saving trade-off that makes perfect sense it's still a really smooth responsive screen we've seen other phones bring high refresh rate down in price so it doesn't really make this one stand out anymore like it used to but that's not a complaint at all I'm clearly a fan of high refresh rate and I'm glad to see it everywhere plus if you're if you're still in the mindset of you work for oneplus and you're trying to cut down on things you get to say you know high refresh rate and high resolution are nice but if you go too high on those things you cut into battery life so we're giving you 90 Hertz and 1080p and that's a good balance to still give you fast and smooth while being friendly to your battery and that's turned out to be absolutely true this phone has a 4300 milliamp hour battery and it's been impressively good on battery life lasting me easily through the end of every day I've tested it with like 15 to 20 percent left over so it's honestly slightly better battery life than the eight pro which I've been running maxed out so I guess I should expect that so then there's three more trade-offs ip68 wireless charging and the cameras the oneplus 8 doesn't have an IP 68 water and dust resistance certification but this is another one of those instances where oneplus would probably claim they've put the necessary seals and pieces inside the phone and tested it themselves but then passed on the savings of not getting it officially tested I don't know about that I haven't tested mine I'll wait for the jury rig everything test to see those seals thank you very much but then this phone straight up doesn't have wireless charging at all same deals last year it has a glass back but it doesn't have the wireless charging coil to take advantage of that glass back now at 700 bucks there are a way lower number of phones at this price that don't have wireless charging so it's much harder to justify but that's always been I guess one plusses thing you know saying wireless charging isn't fast enough for their standards so again there's still fast water charging here still warped charge 30 T so zero to 50% in 25 minutes and it's included in the box too so all that good stuff but yet no wireless charging it kind of makes me wonder how much per unit like that would cost like could they have just swallowed their pride and put in just an ordinary wireless charging coil on the phone and just been like you know what finally we added it probably but you know then again they are trying to save money but anyway last but not least there is a different and lesser camera array in the oneplus 8 on paper it's a 48 megapixel main sensor and a different one from the pro then a 16 megapixel ultra wide camera and a dedicated 2 megapixel macro no telephoto and to me that's the correct one to leave out but it's funny there's still a telephoto button in the camera app which punches into 2x but like LG did with the v60 that's just a digital crop in from the main sensor which honestly looks just as good if not better than a cheap telephoto would have now this dedicated macro camera it's kind of fun but honestly not very good quality and I'm not just saying that because it's 2 megapixels like it's just lacking quality it's not a great dynamic range and not great color overall quality is pretty lacking so you know I have some fun taking some macros with it but I think it's one of those cameras that you'd forget about after the first week and then the main camera it does have a 48 megapixel number attached to it but again it's a step down from flagship quality in sharpness and detail and in colors and just overall performance I mean it feels like the classic one plus of the past amazing everything else on the phone subpar camera honestly if you're serious about camera quality you probably shouldn't be looking at this phone you should check out something like the pixel 3a or even the brand-new air quotes brand new iPhone se which looks like it'll have a flagship quality camera for 399 an iPhone quality camera for 399 so definitely stay tuned for the video when I get my hands on that phone very soon should be a fun video also in case you've been wondering what color this phone is just because it's it's looked like a different color and like every shot in this video this interstellar glow is a nightmare honestly it's definitely unique I'll give it that this finish underneath the gives it a different refraction index from different angles you get all kinds of wild colors reflecting off of it but it's a hundred percent one of those phones that looks better on camera and in promos than it does in real life this thing catches more finger prints than the CSI agent of the month do I even don't even have to make this segue dangerously close to lioness territory well you should you should consider something a little more low-key channel sponsor debrand will help you clean up your act if you accidentally pull the trigger on this colorway of the phone personally I think this black camo looks pretty tight so all right here's my summary for 1+8 aside from the crazy color I really like this phone it's got a great display it's great performer for the price obviously really high in specs it's not the king for this price but it's great performer it's got the fast charging it's included in the box it's got oxygen OS to which I've talked about in the past as one of my favorite Android overlays and I frequently get software updates too so it's it's a clean package I could tailor this phone right now and I'd probably be super happy it also happens to be one of the absolute cheapest 5g compatible phones on the market right now it's not why I would buy it but that is a nice bonus for longevity having the phone for four or five years but it's not it's not amazing it's not it's not some special phone like it used to be and really it's the stratification of phone prices over these past couple years that has caused this situation like I remember this just a couple years ago maybe it was longer than I think but high-end phones used to just be like five 600 maybe 650 bucks 700 bucks and so it felt like you were either reaching for racing for the top for the absolute highest end bleeding-edge best phone or racing to the bottom for the cheapest phone the best budget phone and so one plus came along and it sort of slipped right in the middle they were undercutting the flagships they positioned the cells as flagship killers because they were somewhere in the middle but now today we have what like 200 to $300 budget phones we have our 400 500 $600 mid-range phones then we have our seven eight $900 premium phones then we four thousand eleven hundred $1400 ultra premium flagship phones and so there's more chaos there's more activity than ever at like all of these different price ranges so today at this price for $6.99 you could get this or you could get if you wanted a smaller phone you could get galaxy s 10 e or if you absolutely had to have 120 Hertz you could get the Polka phone x2 or if you had to have a gaming phone you could get the red magic phone or if you absolutely wanted the best camera quality you should go for pixel 3a or even the new iPhone se plus earpods Pro plus a wireless charger I usually don't go super in-depth with price in my reviews just because that is one of those things that usually changes over time but I think that's that's something I'm gonna be changing now just because the positioning of these phones maybe ever since like the essential phone sometimes is the reason why they they live or die but yeah one plus eight it's a nice phone it's not special anymore but it is one of the favorites in this awkward middle child price point of $6.99 to start but yeah look around there's a whole landscape out there thanks to the stratification of pricing I guess but maybe you can watch other videos about those other options too either way thanks for watching this one catch you guys in the next one very soon peace,0.0,3.200000047683716
4,4,QlGqZCFfZOs,okay this phone the 1+8 was basically built with the purpose of beating the iphone 11 everything from the cameras to the pricing to the color choice makes it pretty clear what oneplus have their sights set on so let's find out if it does that I've just launched another video alongside this one which is the highest end one plus eight pro versus the best from Samsung so after this video do check that one out too also that custom mr. who's the boss poster you can see behind me that's from displayed to sponsored this video but more on that later in terms of the media kit that I received with this won't recede it's more or less the same unboxing experience as for the oneplus 8 pro which I covered in the other video if you want to have a look but I will just reiterate this I love the retail packaging on these new oneplus phones if oneplus are going to raise the prices of their phones from mid-range to almost high-end it's at least good to see that they're presented accordingly the one plus eight is pretty much the most comfortable phone I've ever held the phone has the same curved back and soft touch matte finish as its pro counterpart but it's slimmer it has a smaller camera bump and is noticeably lighter that my friends is quite the combination it feels better than my Samsung to holds better than the Huawei it feels sure-enough better than the iPhone 11 at that said the iPhone 11 is hardly a bad feeling phone I like the matte rails all the way around the sides and it's palm friendly size it's almost completely usable with one hand which brings me to the only thing I would say about the 1+8 design it may be the slimmer and lighter phone from the company but it's still not small the display is tall enough that I can still barely reach halfway up with my thumb Bunce that display holy moly the difference is just astronomical by every possible metric I could think of oneplus has the better panel it's larger six point five five inches versus six point one it uses a more low tech for deeper contrast than Apple's LCD and it's much higher resolution you're looking at a full HD plus panel which gives it about 80% more pixels on its screen than the iPhone but the gap gets bigger you've got one plus is slim border and tiny hole punch cutout which makes the iPhone look a little bit like a toy in comparison and it's brighter a little brighter if you're looking head-on but because of our LCD screen quality tends to deteriorate from harsh viewing angles oneplus is much brighter when you're looking from anywhere but head on I really can't emphasize this enough from the front these phones quite literally look five years apart this is the high-end BMW 2 this phone's Fiat 500 and add to that the 1+8 has a fluid ninety Hertz refresh rate versus ethyl 60 so it's more responsive - it's not 120 Hertz like the 1 + 8 Pro but I think there is a bigger jump between 60 and 90 then there is between 90 and 120 oh yeah and also in the screen of the 1 plus you've got a fingerprint scanner with a scanning area wide enough that you can even miss it slightly and you'll still get in well with the iPhone you'll be using secure 3d face and locking which to be fair is probably the most seamless option between the two one plus does her face scanning - but because it's just using a front camera not a proper 3d scanner it could potentially in theory be breached by someone if they really really want to get into your phone anyways well the iPhones display doesn't exactly fill you with confidence you can't say this is not a seriously fast phone in terms of performance it's every bit as well SPECT as the thousand-dollar iPhone 11 Pro it sings along no matter the task whatever game whatever app you'll struggle to make the phone skip a beat mind you the same thing is true for oneplus it's using the latest snapdragon 865 chip ultra-fast ufs 3.0 storage and up to 12 gigs of ram the only thing it loses versus the 8 pro is that it has slightly older lpddr4 x rammed versus lpddr4 which consumes a little more power and isn't quite as fast between these two the oneplus and the iphone and due to benchmark will tell you one plus is about 20% faster if you wanted to put a number on it but I personally struggle to see a difference what I did notice though with the oneplus whether it's slightly more up to date spec sheet is a couple of more general performance improvements a better Wi-Fi range for example I could sit in my back garden watching videos on this and 5g for a lot of people this isn't exactly a big deal right now but in two years time when you're still using the same phone it might well be you might want to be able to pop a 5g sim card in it's tricky though because I think given the choice oneplus wouldn't have added 5g to this non-pro 1+8 because it's expensive it's a big part of the reason why this phone costs what it does the problem is that there's just not enough competition in the smartphone chip market if you want the best performance you need to use qualcomm snapdragon 865 chip but then with that Qualcomm bundles a mandatory 5g modem as well as a result this phone is probably at least 50 dollars more expensive than one plus would have wanted it to be anyways I mentioned earlier that one plus is clearly targeting the iPhone 11 with this and it's kind of obvious I mean everyone wants a piece of apples market share but another telltale sign is specifically what they've done with the cameras both phones have made the decision to have an ultra-wide or skip the telephoto camera which are this kind of upper mid-range slash high-end price is actually quite a rare move so both events have one main camera and one ultra wide and then oneplus also has a third macro camera which to be honest is a bit strange I've got nothing against macro cameras but in my eyes there's a clear hierarchy of importance for smartphone camera systems we've got a high-end main camera you need that then you want an ultra light and then if you've got resources let's have a telephoto and then if you still got resources to spare we'll have a macro camera but in terms of priority it's like you know somewhere down here see a telephoto would have been better but I guess a macro camera is just cheaper maybe the company's still trying to keep three cameras on the phone so it doesn't look like a downgrade from last year's 70 as it stands this macro camera even in ideal lighting conditions is just not very good and has some strange circular lens blur but as far as the two main lenses on the oneplus I'm pretty impressed I was kind of raising my eyebrows during my briefing of the phone because it's actually got the same camera hardware as last year's one plus 70 and very similar to the Wampus seven before that and to be very clear I don't like that idea I would almost expect given that this is a new generation phone supposedly from a company as ambitious as oneplus that we'd be getting new generation camera hardware but I tried to go in removing those preconceptions and I actually came away quite impressed the company is making big strides in software processing for the most part I think one plus is daytime photos look crispier than Apple's and I prefer the slight extra punch adds two scenes plus well neither has a zoom camera one pluses higher resolution main camera means that zoomed photos do look better they've also improved video on the 8 but here Apple is still king the iPhone can just draw out more dynamic range oneplus sort of crushes the shadows a little bit also like with the pro variant if you're trying to focus on fine objects wampler seems to just keep slipping in and out of focus well the iPhone is bang on consistently apart from these camera nickels though a lot of this comparison is just a case of oneplus doing things better than Apple even a lot of the things that have been lacking on Paswan plus phones they've kind of been brought up to par here up to typing and interacting with this phone gives you lovely crispy vibration feedback they want to say as a dolby atmos dual speaker setup one on the front and one on the bottom it's very similar to the one on the iPhone but what I will give to oneplus is that the vocals are even crisper the two main wom plus emissions here our lack of wireless charging and a lack of an official IP certification for water and dust resistance both of which the iPhone has these might be big issues for you for me personally they're small especially against the backdrop of the battery situation while oneplus ships with the powerful 30 watt fast charger the iPhone ships would have 5 watt charger that would have made 2011 proud and it takes like 3 hours to fully charge and one plus is battery capacity is also larger with 4300 milliamperes versus Apple 3110 but iPhones tend to be more efficient with the battery they do have so we'll find out in a detail battery comparison very soon if you could subscribe for that that would be amazing on balance then the only real case to be made for the iPhone 11 / the oneplus is software this is an Android versus iOS situation so if things like FaceTime and airdrop and being able to make phone calls on your Mac if these things are really important to you then you should think carefully about moving to Android because you'll lose them but for every other user Android users Apple users who aren't to invest it and those poor souls still on a blackberry phone this is a one plus victory right out the box almost everything is the way I would want it on my phone it gets a lot of the big things right but also a lot of the small things you've got a slick clean user interface I swipe up anywhere on your screen to bring up your app drawer I swipe down for your quick toggles double tap to switch from back to front camera simple things and also hardware wise that fingerprint-resistant matte finish 128 gigabytes of storage on the base model and the fact that the phone comes pre fitted with a screen protector these are all great user friendly decisions I won't spoil it just yet but I am working on a video of my top current smartphones and this features pretty highly and speaking of things that feature highly displayed think posters for the modern era high end high resolution metal plates with whatever you want printed on them I've got a whole load of them here different styles different sizes some generic some customized and each one has what looks like a handwritten signature and a hologram tag to show authenticity and this is cool you can see I've currently got a future Spacey type theme one going on there but you can change it it uses a magnetic mounting system so once you've set one up you can just chop and change it free well you might have noticed actually I changed it partway through filming this video and the benefit of it being metal is that it's not gonna rip it's not gonna crease and it's got this awesome matte lightly textured finish it doesn't look cheap at all the company plants a tree for every display sold and I've got a discount link so if you order one to two through it you get 27 percent off and if you order three or more 35% off so that's all in the description would be amazing if you could check them out but having said this is mr. Hughes the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music],0.10000000149011612,4.599999904632568
5,5,XRiUNPf-_-4,[Music] what's up guys mkbhd here and this is the 1 plus 70 so if you followed the leaks take a a promo you've probably seen pretty much every angle of this thing but now it's officially been unveiled I've been using it daily for about a week and this is a pretty easy phone to explain so one plus the company they have they're sort of upper mid-range phones somewhere around five hundred six hundred dollars like one plus seven then they have their premium high-end flagship stuff like one plus seven pro that's closer to seven eight hundred bucks so this phone the one plus seventy kind of kind of a hard name to say out loud it's not the seventy but it's the one plus seventy this phone is sort of a Frankenstein between those two groups it's right between the super high end and the upper mid-range if that makes any sense so to be perfectly clear it is a really great phone for the price which is basically the oneplus special at this point they've continued this fascinating slow creep up in price but when you go over this phone and everything they've combined in here it's pretty on point for what you're getting for $599.95 combination of things despite not being the highest end display you know it gets pretty bright up to a thousand knits so outdoor visibility is no problem and the teardrop not being a little smaller makes it super easy to ignore on this gigantic screen but it's also 1080p not 1440 and the bezels are just a little bit thicker a tiny a bit as you can see and I have noticed some real off-axis color tint and rain bowing and other consistencies like that that you'll notice on not so high-end OLED displays so it's not the super best of the best but it's like right underneath it's right in between it's making sense right they're bringing things down from the higher end phone that makes sense while keeping the sort of baseline of the mid-range the high refresh rate I think is the most important thing that they brought down that I just I love me some 90 Hertz some high refresh rate goodness so that's good to see and then just the design of this phone in general is also a bit of a Frankenstein you've probably noticed it by now there's this or a blue color again although this time it's not as matte as before it's kind of closer to like a satin because it has more of a sheen to it it's not really glossy like some other phones but you definitely do still see fingerprints much more than a matte phone so it's somewhere in between again the 7 pro is more matte than this one but here's some other improvements you do have the alert slider is tighter so it's it's more satisfying to move between the three positions so that's pretty sweet they brought down the high-end really precise haptic motor that's honestly only really matched on Android by the pixel at this point so that was great and they brought the optical fingerprint reader underneath the glass that's also the same sensor as the one from the 7 Pro and I think one of the best in any phone under the glass right now the speakers are also just as good as a 7 throat they sound loud and full and there's also a bigger speaker grow up at the top and charging is now even faster so they're calling it warp charge 30 T it's still a 30 watt fast charger but thanks to improved battery chemistry in the 3800 milliamp hour battery in this phone it'll charge 23% faster then warp charge 30 already did so in other words it's silly fast and it's kind of a you know a different philosophy on battery management on one hand I love you know the little chunkier phones that'll have this massive battery inside and all-day battery life it changes the way I use phones I didn't worry about charging ever during the day but on the other hand a phone that's really trim like this that has crazy fast charging just lets you have this peace of mind at any time you're starting to get low you can just plug in for a couple minutes and be right back up to set 80% so it's like a different kind of confidence in the battery I don't really have a preference between the two it would be great to have both but as of right now I like having this we're charged 30 t they say we'll get you to 70% from dead in half an hour and that's awesome and I believe that but I'm even more impressed by just how much you can add from plugging in for five minutes ten minutes and just giving you a massive boost for the rest of the day so the seventy does have decent battery life but this is the steady compromise they make for not having the best battery life and then of course the gigantic camera circle on the back it's genuinely I think the first design from oneplus that doesn't feel to me like really sleek or clean like they've done triple cameras before even but this one is very different it kind of reminds me of somewhere between Motorola or the red hydrogen or you might even remember the Nokia Lumia series back in the day so anything is these are essentially the same exact cameras that the oneplus 7 pro already has same standard 48 megapixel standard camera same 117 degree ultra wide and then a shorter 2x telephoto zoom camera instead of a 3x so if you're actually looking for some big camera improvements for the 70 that is not what's happening here and it's actually not like the 1 plus 7 pro camera was bad it's just that it was the one part of the phone that wasn't you know best-in-class world class it sort of held it back from being an arguably perfect phone in a way but in a $600 phone in 2019 this set of cameras is perfectly good I've been taking photos and videos with it just to see if I notice any substantial differences around but there isn't anything too drastic still very solid and daylight and a bit color fringy and soft around the edges with close up subjects and passable but not amazing shots in less than ideal lighting if you think about other cameras in this six hundred dollar price range that's about right actually right up until they start to get blown out the water by the $700 iPhone 11 you can take portrait mode shots now in telephoto or standard cameras now which is cool and they are also enabling 4k 30fps video from the ultra wide camera so they've heard our feedback they are going to do that and I think them impressive improvement here is the new super macro mode so you hit this little flower icon in the top corner and you can get way up close to things to point five to eight centimeters away from the camera lens which most smartphones do struggle with if they don't have a macro mode and so with this I was able to take some close-ups that I couldn't even get with the iPhone 11 and then of course this wouldn't be a new one plus phone without really killer high-end on paper specs and so that's what they've done here again so Snapdragon a 55 plus the newest chip eight gigs of ram not 12 and 128 or 256 gigs of ufs 3.0 storage so yeah this thing is fast and it's running the latest version of oxygen OS 10 on top of Android 10 which I think makes this the first non pixel Android 10 phone I've used and it's been really good so far I obviously love that they're early 2 updates and performance has actually been really smooth you may have noticed I didn't keep the Android 10 gestures the swipe gestures turned on here's why Android 10 gestures on this phone are a swipe up from the bottom for home 1/2 swipe up for multitasking and then a swipe in from the lower side to go back from anywhere you know what else uses that swipe to go back on the side a lot of Android apps for other things Twitter to switch between accounts flamingo for Twitter tick tick my tasks app YouTube studio Google Photos the Play Store I mean a lot of Google apps use that hamburger menu and the screen is so big on this phone that I don't really want to reach up to the corner with one hand to press the hamburger menu every single time so I don't so I turned it off and I just keep using the buttons for now but aside from that Android 10 has been really nice really smooth as you'd expect on a new phone with a 90 Hertz screen and all the optimizations oneplus is continually working on for oxygen OS they really show so all that for me using this phone has added up to it being a pretty solid set of trade-offs that add up to a pretty good phone for a pretty great price it really feels like they're taking the stuff that they learned how to do better and more efficiently from the 7 Pro and bringing it down to a more competitive price which is a great way of sell a lot of phones now for to be perfectly clear the oneplus 7 pro is still a better phone than this just because of this small bit of trade-offs they've kept a higher quality display higher resolution not as much color fringing and things like that bigger battery less ugly camera bump on the back and the knotch less screen on the front so all of that sort of adds up to a little bit of trade-offs here but overall this is that incremental update you expect from a t phone from oneplus with the X Factor of that 90 Hertz display that is so hard to switch back from so that's the statement that the phone leaves me with is that I'm glad that oneplus is doubling down on the high refresh rate stuff to really make phones feel smooth high refresh rate all the things please this is gonna be a really good buy for people who want to spend like 600 bucks on a phone but for me I'm personally going to be pretty excited about the 1 + 7 T pro names are getting weird but that's the phone that's gonna have the best of the best that I'm looking forward to but yeah not bad I'll have a link below if you want to check it out that's been it thank you for watching and I catch you guys the next one peace,0.20000000298023224,3.0999999046325684
6,6,jdXQZW8qgrs,all right we're here with SAP also known as super SAP on YouTube videos are made on YouTube by you that's right man it's a good time isn't it it is it's the first I mean here in Toronto we got to talk about the hot smartphone topics this is one plus going at Apple the big dawgs with this tweet right here in which they say I dare you small lowercase I the caption within the image there hey Siri which is India's number one premium smartphone it happens to be 1 plus suits right give it a shot I have an iPhone let's see if I bet they're lying hey Siri which is the number one premium smartphone in India it is of course the oneplus oh it is ok cool like what is a premium smartphone this states that oneplus occupies 33% of the premium market in India Samsung 34 and Apple 23 I'm assuming that premium in India is somewhere around $500 and up somewhere in that territory even more expensive than here though like brand what I've heard from the Indian follows I'm sure you have as well is that they have to pay like almost double what we'd have to pay the funny thing is if you shift the marketplace and you talk about North America mmm then you don't talk about oneplus as a premium yeah it's kind of like mid-range we refer to as mid-range something like this yeah the same in the UK right a lot of people that don't live in and you don't realize how successful oneplus has been in India its massive like whenever I put a 1 plus video up on I'm sure you've had the same the response specially from the Indian audience is massive like so here you can buy 2 1 plus potentially 2 1 + 60's for the same price as an iPhone over there I'm assuming you could probably buy like three right so fit the whole family exactly there's a reason that oneplus has had so much success in in India and elsewhere hmm the idea of premium for less as opposed to it's a budget alternative like its own you would only want a oneplus device if you can't one of the others I think even if you compared the oneplus to something which is stock Android the pixels for example this still feels faster and smoother I still prefer the speed and just the overall performance of oneplus device it's crazy what this brand has achieved to be honest to be on the spectrum of brands like Samsung and Apple who had such a head start in the space oh yeah showcases how quickly things can change in the smartphone game and are changing yeah - now at least having the conversation about what is the value for money hmm like this is better for everyone because what does it end up doing if they can bring that price point down all of a sudden you have Samsung talking about the the em stuff in India they're gonna have their you know that other budget brand Apple's talking about being overpriced Tim Cook said it recently it's all good for the consumer competition is is Kidman I've said this many times on my channel that when it comes to bang for buck oneplus is the brand to go for they come in straight away with a competitive price I'm like you know what you're getting and you can go in there you can buy a phone and you will generally be pleased it takes most of the box as for most people oneplus has been clever let's not discount the old model yeah let's just crank out another one you forget about a phone that was out in fed when it's December right yes old news where is if you have another version of it he gets people talking again you want the fresh one you want the fresh one you want the new one and that's what everybody's talking about they get the press coverage they get us guys talking about it what oneplus is doing is very smart if Apple was interviewed if they asked him cooks he'd be like what's worse once less yeah I mean just the fact that if you remember the oneplus sixty event in Brooklyn New York Apple went in and had the iPad event an hour before it was kind of like all right we're just gonna question you like flicking a fly yep flick him fly I've been on a net yeah now one thing to remember here is that a lot of people you know put value on on brand affinity like how does a brand make you feel how long have they been around how trusted are they we're sitting here talking about how amazing it is what oneplus has accomplished in such a short period of time it's important to note that they're they're not Samsung they're not Apple they may never be one plus if you if you ask somebody oh one plus somebody my friends will be like what when you post a video like what the views that you get on a 1 plus video are not commensurate with the public perception of the brand mmm it gets similar views to a Samsung video but where are those views coming from well they might be more globally distributed that's what I think it is because when I post something Sam single Apple like US and UK right right but then one plus it's a little bit varied like it's more international so I think there are some areas where oneplus is a familiar brand if you have an iPhone you're gonna buy it and that's why I mean we're so many generations deep into it in just getting out that ecosystem is too difficult for you whereas if you're somebody new and you're kind of looking around you're like okay maybe one plus is gonna be an option in those markets [Music],0.10000000149011612,1.899999976158142
