0,hey what's up guys mkbhd here and this,2.419,7.361,OHP1rLwR6r8
1,this is one plus eight,6.89,5.56,OHP1rLwR6r8
2,now oneplus didn't just also come out,9.78,5.04,OHP1rLwR6r8
3,with a one plus eight pro this is the,12.45,5.61,OHP1rLwR6r8
4,phone one plus would mark it as flagship,14.82,5.4,OHP1rLwR6r8
5,killer right but we all see oneplus,18.06,3.93,OHP1rLwR6r8
6,slowly moving away from that direction,20.22,4.02,OHP1rLwR6r8
7,now they have a different slogan fast,21.99,4.08,OHP1rLwR6r8
8,and smooth and you can tell they're,24.24,3.09,OHP1rLwR6r8
9,getting away from the flagship killer,26.07,2.91,OHP1rLwR6r8
10,thing now that they actually make a,27.33,4.859,OHP1rLwR6r8
11,flagship but this is exactly what I'd,28.98,5.16,OHP1rLwR6r8
12,expect from the oneplus that I feel like,32.189,3.691,OHP1rLwR6r8
13,we've always known so this interstellar,34.14,5.22,OHP1rLwR6r8
14,glow one plus eight star set $6.99 and,35.88,5.28,OHP1rLwR6r8
15,it has the bleeding edge high-end specs,39.36,3.26,OHP1rLwR6r8
16,you'd want for fast performance,41.16,4.8,OHP1rLwR6r8
17,snapdragon 865 with the 5g modems in,42.62,6.27,OHP1rLwR6r8
18,there eight or twelve gigs of fast Ram,45.96,6.09,OHP1rLwR6r8
19,ufs 3.0 storage Wi-Fi six like that's,48.89,5.559,OHP1rLwR6r8
20,all nice it's a fast phone definitely,52.05,3.87,OHP1rLwR6r8
21,love that but there are a few things,54.449,5.731,OHP1rLwR6r8
22,here cut down to save cost and I'll,55.92,6.27,OHP1rLwR6r8
23,compare this a lot to the 1+8 pro so if,60.18,2.91,OHP1rLwR6r8
24,you haven't watched that it's the,62.19,2.67,OHP1rLwR6r8
25,previous video firstly pull the like,63.09,2.97,OHP1rLwR6r8
26,button if you want to watch it to catch,64.86,3.689,OHP1rLwR6r8
27,up that's there but the story is if you,66.06,4.5,OHP1rLwR6r8
28,work for one plus and you started off,68.549,4.411,OHP1rLwR6r8
29,with this nine hundred two thousand,70.56,3.629,OHP1rLwR6r8
30,dollar phone and you're like alright,72.96,3.659,OHP1rLwR6r8
31,what are we gonna cut out of this phone,74.189,5.851,OHP1rLwR6r8
32,to get the price way down but still give,76.619,5.551,OHP1rLwR6r8
33,people a pretty close to a flagship,80.04,5.52,OHP1rLwR6r8
34,experience what would we do well this is,82.17,5.19,OHP1rLwR6r8
35,what they did first of all its overall a,85.56,4.14,OHP1rLwR6r8
36,bit of a smaller form factor now it's by,87.36,5.07,OHP1rLwR6r8
37,no means a small phone it's definitely,89.7,4.95,OHP1rLwR6r8
38,still big it has a six point five five,92.43,4.35,OHP1rLwR6r8
39,inch display which makes it still a,94.65,5.219,OHP1rLwR6r8
40,little taller than the iPhone 11 pro max,96.78,5.22,OHP1rLwR6r8
41,so it's not small but it is a little bit,99.869,3.991,OHP1rLwR6r8
42,smaller than the eight pro and it's also,102.0,3.99,OHP1rLwR6r8
43,definitely lighter it's noticeably,103.86,4.41,OHP1rLwR6r8
44,lighter to me it's 180 grams on paper to,105.99,4.71,OHP1rLwR6r8
45,be exact and to me it feels comfortable,108.27,4.559,OHP1rLwR6r8
46,in the hand then there's that display it,110.7,3.9,OHP1rLwR6r8
47,still has the optical fingerprint reader,112.829,4.171,OHP1rLwR6r8
48,underneath it's still HDR 10 plus,114.6,4.559,OHP1rLwR6r8
49,certified and still super color accurate,117.0,4.38,OHP1rLwR6r8
50,and much brighter than last year which,119.159,4.021,OHP1rLwR6r8
51,is key so it's super visible outdoors,121.38,5.669,OHP1rLwR6r8
52,but now it's 1080p resolution instead of,123.18,6.21,OHP1rLwR6r8
53,1440 that's a smart move that they've,127.049,5.101,OHP1rLwR6r8
54,done in the past and it's also now high,129.39,4.23,OHP1rLwR6r8
55,refresh rate at,132.15,4.259,OHP1rLwR6r8
56,90 Hertz instead of 120 Hertz I'd love,133.62,4.44,OHP1rLwR6r8
57,to get blind tested on this but I've,136.409,3.66,OHP1rLwR6r8
58,said I can personally see the difference,138.06,5.97,OHP1rLwR6r8
59,between 90 and 120 Hertz but it's small,140.069,5.551,OHP1rLwR6r8
60,and you have to be looking for it,144.03,3.629,OHP1rLwR6r8
61,but I'll definitely prefer either of,145.62,4.35,OHP1rLwR6r8
62,those two 60 Hertz because that,147.659,5.521,OHP1rLwR6r8
63,difference is visually huge so this is,149.97,5.01,OHP1rLwR6r8
64,still high refresh rate so this is a,153.18,3.3,OHP1rLwR6r8
65,cost-saving trade-off that makes perfect,154.98,3.899,OHP1rLwR6r8
66,sense it's still a really smooth,156.48,4.5,OHP1rLwR6r8
67,responsive screen we've seen other,158.879,4.021,OHP1rLwR6r8
68,phones bring high refresh rate down in,160.98,3.569,OHP1rLwR6r8
69,price so it doesn't really make this one,162.9,3.0,OHP1rLwR6r8
70,stand out anymore,164.549,3.06,OHP1rLwR6r8
71,like it used to but that's not a,165.9,3.51,OHP1rLwR6r8
72,complaint at all I'm clearly a fan of,167.609,3.24,OHP1rLwR6r8
73,high refresh rate and I'm glad to see it,169.41,3.15,OHP1rLwR6r8
74,everywhere plus if you're if you're,170.849,3.03,OHP1rLwR6r8
75,still in the mindset of you work for,172.56,2.85,OHP1rLwR6r8
76,oneplus and you're trying to cut down on,173.879,3.901,OHP1rLwR6r8
77,things you get to say you know high,175.41,4.26,OHP1rLwR6r8
78,refresh rate and high resolution are,177.78,4.53,OHP1rLwR6r8
79,nice but if you go too high on those,179.67,4.86,OHP1rLwR6r8
80,things you cut into battery life so,182.31,5.25,OHP1rLwR6r8
81,we're giving you 90 Hertz and 1080p and,184.53,4.769,OHP1rLwR6r8
82,that's a good balance to still give you,187.56,4.649,OHP1rLwR6r8
83,fast and smooth while being friendly to,189.299,4.141,OHP1rLwR6r8
84,your battery and that's turned out to be,192.209,4.261,OHP1rLwR6r8
85,absolutely true this phone has a 4300,193.44,4.74,OHP1rLwR6r8
86,milliamp hour battery and it's been,196.47,2.91,OHP1rLwR6r8
87,impressively good on battery life,198.18,3.239,OHP1rLwR6r8
88,lasting me easily through the end of,199.38,4.77,OHP1rLwR6r8
89,every day I've tested it with like 15 to,201.419,5.281,OHP1rLwR6r8
90,20 percent left over so it's honestly,204.15,4.5,OHP1rLwR6r8
91,slightly better battery life than the,206.7,4.2,OHP1rLwR6r8
92,eight pro which I've been running maxed,208.65,3.54,OHP1rLwR6r8
93,out so I guess I should expect that so,210.9,4.16,OHP1rLwR6r8
94,then there's three more trade-offs ip68,212.19,6.0,OHP1rLwR6r8
95,wireless charging and the cameras the,215.06,5.829,OHP1rLwR6r8
96,oneplus 8 doesn't have an IP 68 water,218.19,5.07,OHP1rLwR6r8
97,and dust resistance certification but,220.889,3.871,OHP1rLwR6r8
98,this is another one of those instances,223.26,3.03,OHP1rLwR6r8
99,where oneplus would probably claim,224.76,3.78,OHP1rLwR6r8
100,they've put the necessary seals and,226.29,4.05,OHP1rLwR6r8
101,pieces inside the phone and tested it,228.54,3.75,OHP1rLwR6r8
102,themselves but then passed on the,230.34,3.539,OHP1rLwR6r8
103,savings of not getting it officially,232.29,4.02,OHP1rLwR6r8
104,tested I don't know about that I haven't,233.879,4.2,OHP1rLwR6r8
105,tested mine I'll wait for the jury rig,236.31,3.87,OHP1rLwR6r8
106,everything test to see those seals thank,238.079,3.211,OHP1rLwR6r8
107,you very much but then this phone,240.18,2.22,OHP1rLwR6r8
108,straight up doesn't have wireless,241.29,3.809,OHP1rLwR6r8
109,charging at all same deals last year it,242.4,4.919,OHP1rLwR6r8
110,has a glass back but it doesn't have the,245.099,4.651,OHP1rLwR6r8
111,wireless charging coil to take advantage,247.319,4.681,OHP1rLwR6r8
112,of that glass back now at 700 bucks,249.75,4.829,OHP1rLwR6r8
113,there are a way lower number of phones,252.0,4.949,OHP1rLwR6r8
114,at this price that don't have wireless,254.579,4.5,OHP1rLwR6r8
115,charging so it's much harder to justify,256.949,3.481,OHP1rLwR6r8
116,but that's always been I guess one,259.079,3.33,OHP1rLwR6r8
117,plusses thing you know saying wireless,260.43,3.479,OHP1rLwR6r8
118,charging isn't fast enough for their,262.409,3.81,OHP1rLwR6r8
119,standards so again there's still fast,263.909,3.421,OHP1rLwR6r8
120,water charging here,266.219,4.26,OHP1rLwR6r8
121,still warped charge 30 T so zero to 50%,267.33,5.28,OHP1rLwR6r8
122,in 25 minutes and it's included in the,270.479,4.981,OHP1rLwR6r8
123,box too so all that good stuff but yet,272.61,4.41,OHP1rLwR6r8
124,no wireless charging it kind of makes me,275.46,6.0,OHP1rLwR6r8
125,wonder how much per unit like that would,277.02,5.85,OHP1rLwR6r8
126,cost like could they have just swallowed,281.46,3.449,OHP1rLwR6r8
127,their pride and put in just an ordinary,282.87,3.81,OHP1rLwR6r8
128,wireless charging coil on the phone and,284.909,3.121,OHP1rLwR6r8
129,just been like you know what finally we,286.68,4.979,OHP1rLwR6r8
130,added it probably but you know then,288.03,4.919,OHP1rLwR6r8
131,again they are trying to save money but,291.659,2.94,OHP1rLwR6r8
132,anyway last but not least there is a,292.949,4.44,OHP1rLwR6r8
133,different and lesser camera array in the,294.599,5.07,OHP1rLwR6r8
134,oneplus 8 on paper it's a 48 megapixel,297.389,4.5,OHP1rLwR6r8
135,main sensor and a different one from the,299.669,5.161,OHP1rLwR6r8
136,pro then a 16 megapixel ultra wide,301.889,6.391,OHP1rLwR6r8
137,camera and a dedicated 2 megapixel macro,304.83,5.88,OHP1rLwR6r8
138,no telephoto and to me that's the,308.28,3.96,OHP1rLwR6r8
139,correct one to leave out but it's funny,310.71,3.57,OHP1rLwR6r8
140,there's still a telephoto button in the,312.24,4.2,OHP1rLwR6r8
141,camera app which punches into 2x but,314.28,4.83,OHP1rLwR6r8
142,like LG did with the v60 that's just a,316.44,4.77,OHP1rLwR6r8
143,digital crop in from the main sensor,319.11,4.739,OHP1rLwR6r8
144,which honestly looks just as good if not,321.21,5.19,OHP1rLwR6r8
145,better than a cheap telephoto would have,323.849,5.13,OHP1rLwR6r8
146,now this dedicated macro camera it's,326.4,4.949,OHP1rLwR6r8
147,kind of fun but honestly not very good,328.979,3.69,OHP1rLwR6r8
148,quality and I'm not just saying that,331.349,3.6,OHP1rLwR6r8
149,because it's 2 megapixels like it's just,332.669,4.5,OHP1rLwR6r8
150,lacking quality it's not a great dynamic,334.949,4.351,OHP1rLwR6r8
151,range and not great color overall,337.169,4.321,OHP1rLwR6r8
152,quality is pretty lacking so you know I,339.3,4.079,OHP1rLwR6r8
153,have some fun taking some macros with it,341.49,3.179,OHP1rLwR6r8
154,but I think it's one of those cameras,343.379,2.85,OHP1rLwR6r8
155,that you'd forget about after the first,344.669,3.93,OHP1rLwR6r8
156,week and then the main camera it does,346.229,4.47,OHP1rLwR6r8
157,have a 48 megapixel number attached to,348.599,3.841,OHP1rLwR6r8
158,it but again it's a step down from,350.699,3.9,OHP1rLwR6r8
159,flagship quality in sharpness and detail,352.44,4.83,OHP1rLwR6r8
160,and in colors and just overall,354.599,3.99,OHP1rLwR6r8
161,performance I mean it feels like the,357.27,4.049,OHP1rLwR6r8
162,classic one plus of the past amazing,358.589,4.89,OHP1rLwR6r8
163,everything else on the phone subpar,361.319,3.84,OHP1rLwR6r8
164,camera honestly if you're serious about,363.479,3.211,OHP1rLwR6r8
165,camera quality you probably shouldn't be,365.159,2.82,OHP1rLwR6r8
166,looking at this phone you should check,366.69,3.87,OHP1rLwR6r8
167,out something like the pixel 3a or even,367.979,3.541,OHP1rLwR6r8
168,the brand-new,370.56,4.139,OHP1rLwR6r8
169,air quotes brand new iPhone se which,371.52,4.949,OHP1rLwR6r8
170,looks like it'll have a flagship quality,374.699,4.861,OHP1rLwR6r8
171,camera for 399 an iPhone quality camera,376.469,5.281,OHP1rLwR6r8
172,for 399 so definitely stay tuned for the,379.56,4.199,OHP1rLwR6r8
173,video when I get my hands on that phone,381.75,3.87,OHP1rLwR6r8
174,very soon should be a fun video also in,383.759,3.84,OHP1rLwR6r8
175,case you've been wondering what color,385.62,4.38,OHP1rLwR6r8
176,this phone is just because it's it's,387.599,3.6,OHP1rLwR6r8
177,looked like a different color and like,390.0,2.699,OHP1rLwR6r8
178,every shot in this video this,391.199,5.7,OHP1rLwR6r8
179,interstellar glow is a nightmare,392.699,6.181,OHP1rLwR6r8
180,honestly it's definitely unique I'll,396.899,4.481,OHP1rLwR6r8
181,give it that this finish underneath the,398.88,4.87,OHP1rLwR6r8
182,gives it a different refraction index,401.38,4.53,OHP1rLwR6r8
183,from different angles you get all kinds,403.75,4.44,OHP1rLwR6r8
184,of wild colors reflecting off of it but,405.91,3.54,OHP1rLwR6r8
185,it's a hundred percent one of those,408.19,3.24,OHP1rLwR6r8
186,phones that looks better on camera and,409.45,4.23,OHP1rLwR6r8
187,in promos than it does in real life this,411.43,3.87,OHP1rLwR6r8
188,thing catches more finger prints than,413.68,3.83,OHP1rLwR6r8
189,the CSI agent of the month do I even,415.3,6.26,OHP1rLwR6r8
190,don't even have to make this segue,417.51,4.05,OHP1rLwR6r8
191,dangerously close to lioness territory,422.04,3.31,OHP1rLwR6r8
192,well you should you should consider,424.21,3.27,OHP1rLwR6r8
193,something a little more low-key channel,425.35,3.48,OHP1rLwR6r8
194,sponsor debrand will help you clean up,427.48,3.36,OHP1rLwR6r8
195,your act if you accidentally pull the,428.83,3.54,OHP1rLwR6r8
196,trigger on this colorway of the phone,430.84,4.11,OHP1rLwR6r8
197,personally I think this black camo looks,432.37,3.9,OHP1rLwR6r8
198,pretty tight so all right here's my,434.95,4.47,OHP1rLwR6r8
199,summary for 1+8 aside from the crazy,436.27,5.55,OHP1rLwR6r8
200,color I really like this phone it's got,439.42,4.47,OHP1rLwR6r8
201,a great display it's great performer for,441.82,4.08,OHP1rLwR6r8
202,the price obviously really high in specs,443.89,4.02,OHP1rLwR6r8
203,it's not the king for this price but,445.9,3.69,OHP1rLwR6r8
204,it's great performer it's got the fast,447.91,3.45,OHP1rLwR6r8
205,charging it's included in the box,449.59,3.96,OHP1rLwR6r8
206,it's got oxygen OS to which I've talked,451.36,3.57,OHP1rLwR6r8
207,about in the past as one of my favorite,453.55,3.75,OHP1rLwR6r8
208,Android overlays and I frequently get,454.93,4.47,OHP1rLwR6r8
209,software updates too so it's it's a,457.3,3.78,OHP1rLwR6r8
210,clean package I could tailor this phone,459.4,3.3,OHP1rLwR6r8
211,right now and I'd probably be super,461.08,4.02,OHP1rLwR6r8
212,happy it also happens to be one of the,462.7,5.28,OHP1rLwR6r8
213,absolute cheapest 5g compatible phones,465.1,5.28,OHP1rLwR6r8
214,on the market right now it's not why I,467.98,4.62,OHP1rLwR6r8
215,would buy it but that is a nice bonus,470.38,4.71,OHP1rLwR6r8
216,for longevity having the phone for four,472.6,4.62,OHP1rLwR6r8
217,or five years but it's not it's not,475.09,4.47,OHP1rLwR6r8
218,amazing it's not it's not some special,477.22,5.22,OHP1rLwR6r8
219,phone like it used to be and really it's,479.56,5.46,OHP1rLwR6r8
220,the stratification of phone prices over,482.44,4.77,OHP1rLwR6r8
221,these past couple years that has caused,485.02,3.99,OHP1rLwR6r8
222,this situation like I remember this just,487.21,3.63,OHP1rLwR6r8
223,a couple years ago maybe it was longer,489.01,3.72,OHP1rLwR6r8
224,than I think but high-end phones used to,490.84,4.86,OHP1rLwR6r8
225,just be like five 600 maybe 650 bucks,492.73,5.16,OHP1rLwR6r8
226,700 bucks and so it felt like you were,495.7,4.92,OHP1rLwR6r8
227,either reaching for racing for the top,497.89,4.17,OHP1rLwR6r8
228,for the absolute highest end,500.62,5.04,OHP1rLwR6r8
229,bleeding-edge best phone or racing to,502.06,5.55,OHP1rLwR6r8
230,the bottom for the cheapest phone the,505.66,4.8,OHP1rLwR6r8
231,best budget phone and so one plus came,507.61,4.92,OHP1rLwR6r8
232,along and it sort of slipped right in,510.46,3.6,OHP1rLwR6r8
233,the middle they were undercutting the,512.53,3.689,OHP1rLwR6r8
234,flagships they positioned the cells as,514.06,4.01,OHP1rLwR6r8
235,flagship killers because they were,516.219,4.831,OHP1rLwR6r8
236,somewhere in the middle but now today we,518.07,6.52,OHP1rLwR6r8
237,have what like 200 to $300 budget phones,521.05,8.01,OHP1rLwR6r8
238,we have our 400 500 $600 mid-range,524.59,7.97,OHP1rLwR6r8
239,phones then we have our seven eight $900,529.06,5.43,OHP1rLwR6r8
240,premium phones then we,532.56,6.16,OHP1rLwR6r8
241,four thousand eleven hundred $1400 ultra,534.49,7.2,OHP1rLwR6r8
242,premium flagship phones and so there's,538.72,4.71,OHP1rLwR6r8
243,more chaos there's more activity than,541.69,3.06,OHP1rLwR6r8
244,ever at like all of these different,543.43,3.66,OHP1rLwR6r8
245,price ranges so today at this price for,544.75,5.7,OHP1rLwR6r8
246,$6.99 you could get this or you could,547.09,5.01,OHP1rLwR6r8
247,get if you wanted a smaller phone you,550.45,4.53,OHP1rLwR6r8
248,could get galaxy s 10 e or if you,552.1,4.95,OHP1rLwR6r8
249,absolutely had to have 120 Hertz you,554.98,5.13,OHP1rLwR6r8
250,could get the Polka phone x2 or if you,557.05,4.65,OHP1rLwR6r8
251,had to have a gaming phone you could get,560.11,3.63,OHP1rLwR6r8
252,the red magic phone or if you absolutely,561.7,4.11,OHP1rLwR6r8
253,wanted the best camera quality you,563.74,4.71,OHP1rLwR6r8
254,should go for pixel 3a or even the new,565.81,7.17,OHP1rLwR6r8
255,iPhone se plus earpods Pro plus a,568.45,6.18,OHP1rLwR6r8
256,wireless charger I usually don't go,572.98,4.23,OHP1rLwR6r8
257,super in-depth with price in my reviews,574.63,4.05,OHP1rLwR6r8
258,just because that is one of those things,577.21,4.23,OHP1rLwR6r8
259,that usually changes over time but I,578.68,4.5,OHP1rLwR6r8
260,think that's that's something I'm gonna,581.44,3.06,OHP1rLwR6r8
261,be changing now just because the,583.18,4.02,OHP1rLwR6r8
262,positioning of these phones maybe ever,584.5,4.29,OHP1rLwR6r8
263,since like the essential phone sometimes,587.2,5.01,OHP1rLwR6r8
264,is the reason why they they live or die,588.79,4.95,OHP1rLwR6r8
265,but yeah one plus eight it's a nice,592.21,4.08,OHP1rLwR6r8
266,phone it's not special anymore but it is,593.74,4.59,OHP1rLwR6r8
267,one of the favorites in this awkward,596.29,5.16,OHP1rLwR6r8
268,middle child price point of $6.99 to,598.33,5.58,OHP1rLwR6r8
269,start but yeah look around there's a,601.45,4.62,OHP1rLwR6r8
270,whole landscape out there thanks to the,603.91,3.93,OHP1rLwR6r8
271,stratification of pricing I guess but,606.07,4.17,OHP1rLwR6r8
272,maybe you can watch other videos about,607.84,4.5,OHP1rLwR6r8
273,those other options too either way,610.24,3.99,OHP1rLwR6r8
274,thanks for watching this one catch you,612.34,6.5,OHP1rLwR6r8
275,guys in the next one very soon peace,614.23,4.61,OHP1rLwR6r8
0,[Music],1.21,7.27,XRiUNPf-_-4
1,what's up guys mkbhd here and this is,10.639,7.511,XRiUNPf-_-4
2,the 1 plus 70 so if you followed the,13.5,6.689,XRiUNPf-_-4
3,leaks take a a promo you've probably,18.15,3.78,XRiUNPf-_-4
4,seen pretty much every angle of this,20.189,3.51,XRiUNPf-_-4
5,thing but now it's officially been,21.93,4.14,XRiUNPf-_-4
6,unveiled I've been using it daily for,23.699,4.861,XRiUNPf-_-4
7,about a week and this is a pretty easy,26.07,4.5,XRiUNPf-_-4
8,phone to explain so one plus the company,28.56,3.209,XRiUNPf-_-4
9,they have they're sort of upper,30.57,3.21,XRiUNPf-_-4
10,mid-range phones somewhere around five,31.769,3.481,XRiUNPf-_-4
11,hundred six hundred dollars like one,33.78,3.959,XRiUNPf-_-4
12,plus seven then they have their premium,35.25,4.77,XRiUNPf-_-4
13,high-end flagship stuff like one plus,37.739,4.531,XRiUNPf-_-4
14,seven pro that's closer to seven eight,40.02,4.19,XRiUNPf-_-4
15,hundred bucks so this phone the one plus,42.27,5.43,XRiUNPf-_-4
16,seventy kind of kind of a hard name to,44.21,5.11,XRiUNPf-_-4
17,say out loud it's not the seventy but,47.7,4.98,XRiUNPf-_-4
18,it's the one plus seventy this phone is,49.32,6.329,XRiUNPf-_-4
19,sort of a Frankenstein between those two,52.68,3.57,XRiUNPf-_-4
20,groups,55.649,2.46,XRiUNPf-_-4
21,it's right between the super high end,56.25,4.26,XRiUNPf-_-4
22,and the upper mid-range if that makes,58.109,2.941,XRiUNPf-_-4
23,any sense,60.51,2.4,XRiUNPf-_-4
24,so to be perfectly clear it is a really,61.05,3.09,XRiUNPf-_-4
25,great phone for the price which is,62.91,2.999,XRiUNPf-_-4
26,basically the oneplus special at this,64.14,3.9,XRiUNPf-_-4
27,point they've continued this fascinating,65.909,4.411,XRiUNPf-_-4
28,slow creep up in price but when you go,68.04,3.39,XRiUNPf-_-4
29,over this phone and everything they've,70.32,2.94,XRiUNPf-_-4
30,combined in here it's pretty on point,71.43,41.43,XRiUNPf-_-4
31,for what you're getting for $599.95,73.26,41.219,XRiUNPf-_-4
32,combination of things despite not being,112.86,3.869,XRiUNPf-_-4
33,the highest end display you know it gets,114.479,4.261,XRiUNPf-_-4
34,pretty bright up to a thousand knits so,116.729,4.411,XRiUNPf-_-4
35,outdoor visibility is no problem and the,118.74,4.589,XRiUNPf-_-4
36,teardrop not being a little smaller,121.14,4.47,XRiUNPf-_-4
37,makes it super easy to ignore on this,123.329,6.391,XRiUNPf-_-4
38,gigantic screen but it's also 1080p not,125.61,6.75,XRiUNPf-_-4
39,1440 and the bezels are just a little,129.72,3.75,XRiUNPf-_-4
40,bit thicker a tiny,132.36,3.03,XRiUNPf-_-4
41,a bit as you can see and I have noticed,133.47,5.07,XRiUNPf-_-4
42,some real off-axis color tint and rain,135.39,5.1,XRiUNPf-_-4
43,bowing and other consistencies like that,138.54,3.96,XRiUNPf-_-4
44,that you'll notice on not so high-end,140.49,4.68,XRiUNPf-_-4
45,OLED displays so it's not the super best,142.5,4.13,XRiUNPf-_-4
46,of the best but it's like right,145.17,3.69,XRiUNPf-_-4
47,underneath it's right in between it's,146.63,3.52,XRiUNPf-_-4
48,making sense right they're bringing,148.86,3.15,XRiUNPf-_-4
49,things down from the higher end phone,150.15,4.35,XRiUNPf-_-4
50,that makes sense while keeping the sort,152.01,3.09,XRiUNPf-_-4
51,of baseline,154.5,2.55,XRiUNPf-_-4
52,of the mid-range the high refresh rate I,155.1,3.3,XRiUNPf-_-4
53,think is the most important thing that,157.05,3.42,XRiUNPf-_-4
54,they brought down that I just I love me,158.4,3.93,XRiUNPf-_-4
55,some 90 Hertz some high refresh rate,160.47,4.2,XRiUNPf-_-4
56,goodness so that's good to see and then,162.33,4.23,XRiUNPf-_-4
57,just the design of this phone in general,164.67,4.08,XRiUNPf-_-4
58,is also a bit of a Frankenstein you've,166.56,3.54,XRiUNPf-_-4
59,probably noticed it by now there's this,168.75,3.99,XRiUNPf-_-4
60,or a blue color again although this time,170.1,5.22,XRiUNPf-_-4
61,it's not as matte as before it's kind of,172.74,4.469,XRiUNPf-_-4
62,closer to like a satin because it has,175.32,4.08,XRiUNPf-_-4
63,more of a sheen to it it's not really,177.209,4.321,XRiUNPf-_-4
64,glossy like some other phones but you,179.4,4.02,XRiUNPf-_-4
65,definitely do still see fingerprints,181.53,4.98,XRiUNPf-_-4
66,much more than a matte phone so it's,183.42,5.31,XRiUNPf-_-4
67,somewhere in between again the 7 pro is,186.51,3.96,XRiUNPf-_-4
68,more matte than this one but here's some,188.73,3.57,XRiUNPf-_-4
69,other improvements you do have the alert,190.47,3.6,XRiUNPf-_-4
70,slider is tighter so it's it's more,192.3,3.42,XRiUNPf-_-4
71,satisfying to move between the three,194.07,3.36,XRiUNPf-_-4
72,positions so that's pretty sweet,195.72,3.33,XRiUNPf-_-4
73,they brought down the high-end really,197.43,3.809,XRiUNPf-_-4
74,precise haptic motor that's honestly,199.05,3.9,XRiUNPf-_-4
75,only really matched on Android by the,201.239,3.331,XRiUNPf-_-4
76,pixel at this point so that was great,202.95,3.81,XRiUNPf-_-4
77,and they brought the optical fingerprint,204.57,3.69,XRiUNPf-_-4
78,reader underneath the glass that's also,206.76,3.63,XRiUNPf-_-4
79,the same sensor as the one from the 7,208.26,4.56,XRiUNPf-_-4
80,Pro and I think one of the best in any,210.39,4.2,XRiUNPf-_-4
81,phone under the glass right now the,212.82,3.54,XRiUNPf-_-4
82,speakers are also just as good as a 7,214.59,3.48,XRiUNPf-_-4
83,throat they sound loud and full and,216.36,3.659,XRiUNPf-_-4
84,there's also a bigger speaker grow up at,218.07,5.58,XRiUNPf-_-4
85,the top and charging is now even faster,220.019,6.69,XRiUNPf-_-4
86,so they're calling it warp charge 30 T,223.65,5.64,XRiUNPf-_-4
87,it's still a 30 watt fast charger but,226.709,4.231,XRiUNPf-_-4
88,thanks to improved battery chemistry in,229.29,3.84,XRiUNPf-_-4
89,the 3800 milliamp hour battery in this,230.94,5.579,XRiUNPf-_-4
90,phone it'll charge 23% faster then warp,233.13,6.18,XRiUNPf-_-4
91,charge 30 already did so in other words,236.519,4.771,XRiUNPf-_-4
92,it's silly fast and it's kind of a you,239.31,4.32,XRiUNPf-_-4
93,know a different philosophy on battery,241.29,4.8,XRiUNPf-_-4
94,management on one hand I love you know,243.63,4.35,XRiUNPf-_-4
95,the little chunkier phones that'll have,246.09,4.709,XRiUNPf-_-4
96,this massive battery inside and all-day,247.98,4.11,XRiUNPf-_-4
97,battery life it changes the way I use,250.799,3.0,XRiUNPf-_-4
98,phones I didn't worry about charging,252.09,3.149,XRiUNPf-_-4
99,ever during the day but on the other,253.799,3.391,XRiUNPf-_-4
100,hand a phone that's really trim like,255.239,5.28,XRiUNPf-_-4
101,this that has crazy fast charging just,257.19,4.979,XRiUNPf-_-4
102,lets you have this peace of mind at any,260.519,3.361,XRiUNPf-_-4
103,time you're starting to get low you can,262.169,3.721,XRiUNPf-_-4
104,just plug in for a couple minutes and be,263.88,3.16,XRiUNPf-_-4
105,right back up to set,265.89,3.28,XRiUNPf-_-4
106,80% so it's like a different kind of,267.04,3.93,XRiUNPf-_-4
107,confidence in the battery I don't really,269.17,3.45,XRiUNPf-_-4
108,have a preference between the two it,270.97,4.05,XRiUNPf-_-4
109,would be great to have both but as of,272.62,4.2,XRiUNPf-_-4
110,right now I like having this we're,275.02,3.87,XRiUNPf-_-4
111,charged 30 t they say we'll get you to,276.82,5.7,XRiUNPf-_-4
112,70% from dead in half an hour and that's,278.89,5.19,XRiUNPf-_-4
113,awesome and I believe that but I'm even,282.52,2.79,XRiUNPf-_-4
114,more impressed by just how much you can,284.08,3.27,XRiUNPf-_-4
115,add from plugging in for five minutes,285.31,4.23,XRiUNPf-_-4
116,ten minutes and just giving you a,287.35,3.6,XRiUNPf-_-4
117,massive boost for the rest of the day so,289.54,3.15,XRiUNPf-_-4
118,the seventy does have decent battery,290.95,3.42,XRiUNPf-_-4
119,life but this is the steady compromise,292.69,3.39,XRiUNPf-_-4
120,they make for not having the best,294.37,3.93,XRiUNPf-_-4
121,battery life and then of course the,296.08,7.14,XRiUNPf-_-4
122,gigantic camera circle on the back it's,298.3,7.23,XRiUNPf-_-4
123,genuinely I think the first design from,303.22,4.29,XRiUNPf-_-4
124,oneplus that doesn't feel to me like,305.53,3.99,XRiUNPf-_-4
125,really sleek or clean like they've done,307.51,4.89,XRiUNPf-_-4
126,triple cameras before even but this one,309.52,4.62,XRiUNPf-_-4
127,is very different it kind of reminds me,312.4,4.89,XRiUNPf-_-4
128,of somewhere between Motorola or the red,314.14,5.28,XRiUNPf-_-4
129,hydrogen or you might even remember the,317.29,4.11,XRiUNPf-_-4
130,Nokia Lumia series back in the day so,319.42,3.54,XRiUNPf-_-4
131,anything is these are essentially the,321.4,3.78,XRiUNPf-_-4
132,same exact cameras that the oneplus 7,322.96,4.5,XRiUNPf-_-4
133,pro already has same standard 48,325.18,5.37,XRiUNPf-_-4
134,megapixel standard camera same 117,327.46,5.79,XRiUNPf-_-4
135,degree ultra wide and then a shorter 2x,330.55,5.49,XRiUNPf-_-4
136,telephoto zoom camera instead of a 3x so,333.25,4.17,XRiUNPf-_-4
137,if you're actually looking for some big,336.04,4.74,XRiUNPf-_-4
138,camera improvements for the 70 that is,337.42,5.49,XRiUNPf-_-4
139,not what's happening here and it's,340.78,3.81,XRiUNPf-_-4
140,actually not like the 1 plus 7 pro,342.91,3.87,XRiUNPf-_-4
141,camera was bad it's just that it was the,344.59,4.26,XRiUNPf-_-4
142,one part of the phone that wasn't you,346.78,4.8,XRiUNPf-_-4
143,know best-in-class world class it sort,348.85,4.47,XRiUNPf-_-4
144,of held it back from being an arguably,351.58,4.83,XRiUNPf-_-4
145,perfect phone in a way but in a $600,353.32,5.91,XRiUNPf-_-4
146,phone in 2019 this set of cameras is,356.41,4.71,XRiUNPf-_-4
147,perfectly good I've been taking photos,359.23,3.27,XRiUNPf-_-4
148,and videos with it just to see if I,361.12,2.91,XRiUNPf-_-4
149,notice any substantial differences,362.5,3.12,XRiUNPf-_-4
150,around but there isn't anything too,364.03,3.93,XRiUNPf-_-4
151,drastic still very solid and daylight,365.62,4.65,XRiUNPf-_-4
152,and a bit color fringy and soft around,367.96,4.83,XRiUNPf-_-4
153,the edges with close up subjects and,370.27,5.07,XRiUNPf-_-4
154,passable but not amazing shots in less,372.79,4.26,XRiUNPf-_-4
155,than ideal lighting if you think about,375.34,3.84,XRiUNPf-_-4
156,other cameras in this six hundred dollar,377.05,4.91,XRiUNPf-_-4
157,price range that's about right actually,379.18,5.58,XRiUNPf-_-4
158,right up until they start to get blown,381.96,6.43,XRiUNPf-_-4
159,out the water by the $700 iPhone 11 you,384.76,5.4,XRiUNPf-_-4
160,can take portrait mode shots now in,388.39,4.23,XRiUNPf-_-4
161,telephoto or standard cameras now which,390.16,5.25,XRiUNPf-_-4
162,is cool and they are also enabling 4k,392.62,4.92,XRiUNPf-_-4
163,30fps video from the ultra wide camera,395.41,3.99,XRiUNPf-_-4
164,so they've heard our feedback they are,397.54,3.01,XRiUNPf-_-4
165,going to do that and I think them,399.4,3.28,XRiUNPf-_-4
166,impressive improvement here is the new,400.55,4.47,XRiUNPf-_-4
167,super macro mode so you hit this little,402.68,4.44,XRiUNPf-_-4
168,flower icon in the top corner and you,405.02,5.07,XRiUNPf-_-4
169,can get way up close to things to point,407.12,5.01,XRiUNPf-_-4
170,five to eight centimeters away from the,410.09,4.92,XRiUNPf-_-4
171,camera lens which most smartphones do,412.13,4.68,XRiUNPf-_-4
172,struggle with if they don't have a macro,415.01,4.02,XRiUNPf-_-4
173,mode and so with this I was able to take,416.81,3.87,XRiUNPf-_-4
174,some close-ups that I couldn't even get,419.03,2.94,XRiUNPf-_-4
175,with the iPhone 11 and then of course,420.68,2.97,XRiUNPf-_-4
176,this wouldn't be a new one plus phone,421.97,4.74,XRiUNPf-_-4
177,without really killer high-end on paper,423.65,4.8,XRiUNPf-_-4
178,specs and so that's what they've done,426.71,4.53,XRiUNPf-_-4
179,here again so Snapdragon a 55 plus the,428.45,6.5,XRiUNPf-_-4
180,newest chip eight gigs of ram not 12 and,431.24,8.58,XRiUNPf-_-4
181,128 or 256 gigs of ufs 3.0 storage so,434.95,6.67,XRiUNPf-_-4
182,yeah this thing is fast and it's running,439.82,3.81,XRiUNPf-_-4
183,the latest version of oxygen OS 10 on,441.62,4.5,XRiUNPf-_-4
184,top of Android 10 which I think makes,443.63,4.95,XRiUNPf-_-4
185,this the first non pixel Android 10,446.12,4.44,XRiUNPf-_-4
186,phone I've used and it's been really,448.58,3.66,XRiUNPf-_-4
187,good so far I obviously love that,450.56,3.51,XRiUNPf-_-4
188,they're early 2 updates and performance,452.24,3.75,XRiUNPf-_-4
189,has actually been really smooth you may,454.07,3.93,XRiUNPf-_-4
190,have noticed I didn't keep the Android,455.99,4.68,XRiUNPf-_-4
191,10 gestures the swipe gestures turned on,458.0,5.37,XRiUNPf-_-4
192,here's why Android 10 gestures on this,460.67,4.74,XRiUNPf-_-4
193,phone are a swipe up from the bottom for,463.37,4.95,XRiUNPf-_-4
194,home 1/2 swipe up for multitasking and,465.41,5.88,XRiUNPf-_-4
195,then a swipe in from the lower side to,468.32,5.49,XRiUNPf-_-4
196,go back from anywhere you know what else,471.29,4.44,XRiUNPf-_-4
197,uses that swipe to go back on the side a,473.81,4.7,XRiUNPf-_-4
198,lot of Android apps for other things,475.73,5.09,XRiUNPf-_-4
199,Twitter to switch between accounts,478.51,5.77,XRiUNPf-_-4
200,flamingo for Twitter tick tick my tasks,480.82,7.24,XRiUNPf-_-4
201,app YouTube studio Google Photos the,484.28,5.91,XRiUNPf-_-4
202,Play Store I mean a lot of Google apps,488.06,4.38,XRiUNPf-_-4
203,use that hamburger menu and the screen,490.19,4.05,XRiUNPf-_-4
204,is so big on this phone that I don't,492.44,3.12,XRiUNPf-_-4
205,really want to reach up to the corner,494.24,3.21,XRiUNPf-_-4
206,with one hand to press the hamburger,495.56,6.03,XRiUNPf-_-4
207,menu every single time so I don't so I,497.45,5.91,XRiUNPf-_-4
208,turned it off and I just keep using the,501.59,2.94,XRiUNPf-_-4
209,buttons for now but aside from that,503.36,3.15,XRiUNPf-_-4
210,Android 10 has been really nice really,504.53,3.75,XRiUNPf-_-4
211,smooth as you'd expect on a new phone,506.51,4.02,XRiUNPf-_-4
212,with a 90 Hertz screen and all the,508.28,4.05,XRiUNPf-_-4
213,optimizations oneplus is continually,510.53,4.17,XRiUNPf-_-4
214,working on for oxygen OS they really,512.33,4.53,XRiUNPf-_-4
215,show so all that for me using this phone,514.7,4.74,XRiUNPf-_-4
216,has added up to it being a pretty solid,516.86,4.86,XRiUNPf-_-4
217,set of trade-offs that add up to a,519.44,4.86,XRiUNPf-_-4
218,pretty good phone for a pretty great,521.72,3.93,XRiUNPf-_-4
219,price it really feels like they're,524.3,2.76,XRiUNPf-_-4
220,taking the stuff that they learned how,525.65,3.24,XRiUNPf-_-4
221,to do better and more efficiently from,527.06,4.53,XRiUNPf-_-4
222,the 7 Pro and bringing it down to a more,528.89,4.23,XRiUNPf-_-4
223,competitive price which is a great way,531.59,2.7,XRiUNPf-_-4
224,of sell a lot of phones now for,533.12,3.75,XRiUNPf-_-4
225,to be perfectly clear the oneplus 7 pro,534.29,5.7,XRiUNPf-_-4
226,is still a better phone than this just,536.87,4.92,XRiUNPf-_-4
227,because of this small bit of trade-offs,539.99,3.66,XRiUNPf-_-4
228,they've kept a higher quality display,541.79,3.9,XRiUNPf-_-4
229,higher resolution not as much color,543.65,3.78,XRiUNPf-_-4
230,fringing and things like that,545.69,5.13,XRiUNPf-_-4
231,bigger battery less ugly camera bump on,547.43,4.74,XRiUNPf-_-4
232,the back and the knotch less screen on,550.82,3.12,XRiUNPf-_-4
233,the front so all of that sort of adds up,552.17,3.78,XRiUNPf-_-4
234,to a little bit of trade-offs here but,553.94,4.35,XRiUNPf-_-4
235,overall this is that incremental update,555.95,4.56,XRiUNPf-_-4
236,you expect from a t phone from oneplus,558.29,4.68,XRiUNPf-_-4
237,with the X Factor of that 90 Hertz,560.51,5.52,XRiUNPf-_-4
238,display that is so hard to switch back,562.97,4.53,XRiUNPf-_-4
239,from so that's the statement that the,566.03,3.33,XRiUNPf-_-4
240,phone leaves me with is that I'm glad,567.5,3.57,XRiUNPf-_-4
241,that oneplus is doubling down on the,569.36,3.54,XRiUNPf-_-4
242,high refresh rate stuff to really make,571.07,4.62,XRiUNPf-_-4
243,phones feel smooth high refresh rate all,572.9,4.5,XRiUNPf-_-4
244,the things please this is gonna be a,575.69,3.09,XRiUNPf-_-4
245,really good buy for people who want to,577.4,3.9,XRiUNPf-_-4
246,spend like 600 bucks on a phone but for,578.78,2.88,XRiUNPf-_-4
247,me,581.3,2.37,XRiUNPf-_-4
248,I'm personally going to be pretty,581.66,6.36,XRiUNPf-_-4
249,excited about the 1 + 7 T pro names are,583.67,6.09,XRiUNPf-_-4
250,getting weird but that's the phone,588.02,3.33,XRiUNPf-_-4
251,that's gonna have the best of the best,589.76,3.54,XRiUNPf-_-4
252,that I'm looking forward to but yeah not,591.35,3.39,XRiUNPf-_-4

3,using the oneplus 8 pro daily for about,8.849,6.99,LTDuGU38-70
4,two weeks now and I gotta say they did,12.33,5.49,LTDuGU38-70
5,it they finally did it they just went,15.839,3.631,LTDuGU38-70
6,ahead and made a flagship like a,17.82,2.39,LTDuGU38-70
7,bonafide,19.47,5.1,LTDuGU38-70
8,complete feelin flagship phone finally,20.21,6.489,LTDuGU38-70
9,now there are still a few snags and I,24.57,4.02,LTDuGU38-70
10,will nitpick about those because that's,26.699,3.781,LTDuGU38-70
11,what you do in a phone that starts now,28.59,4.5,LTDuGU38-70
12,at nine hundred bucks but still,30.48,4.86,LTDuGU38-70
13,nevertheless really happy to see them,33.09,3.75,LTDuGU38-70
14,finally commit to something like this,35.34,3.12,LTDuGU38-70
15,and it's been a long time coming so,36.84,2.969,LTDuGU38-70
16,today as you may have seen one plus,38.46,3.689,LTDuGU38-70
17,launched their newest highest end phone,39.809,5.401,LTDuGU38-70
18,it's the oneplus 8 pro taking yet,42.149,4.561,LTDuGU38-70
19,another step up in the ladder of their,45.21,2.759,LTDuGU38-70
20,phones getting slightly more expensive,46.71,3.779,LTDuGU38-70
21,every year but alongside it they also,47.969,5.581,LTDuGU38-70
22,dropped the one plus eight which is sort,50.489,5.611,LTDuGU38-70
23,of more like a premium mid-range phone,53.55,5.73,LTDuGU38-70
24,that starts at $6.99 so that that will,56.1,5.07,LTDuGU38-70
25,be its own separate video that'll come,59.28,4.049,LTDuGU38-70
26,out later once I fully daily drive this,61.17,3.419,LTDuGU38-70
27,phone switched to it give it that,63.329,4.351,LTDuGU38-70
28,treatment that's gonna be a tough video,64.589,4.89,LTDuGU38-70
29,to make without all kinds of reflections,67.68,3.479,LTDuGU38-70
30,but definitely subscribe to see that,69.479,3.121,LTDuGU38-70
31,video first when it comes out hit the,71.159,2.791,LTDuGU38-70
32,red button below if you haven't already,72.6,3.9,LTDuGU38-70
33,that's coming up but until then we're,73.95,5.07,LTDuGU38-70
34,talking about this guy the eight pro the,76.5,4.32,LTDuGU38-70
35,flagship so the bleeding edge high-end,79.02,3.3,LTDuGU38-70
36,specs shouldn't be a surprise when we,80.82,3.63,LTDuGU38-70
37,see a new one plus phone I mean beside,82.32,3.839,LTDuGU38-70
38,the fact that they slowly tease out all,84.45,3.72,LTDuGU38-70
39,the specs the weeks leading up to the,86.159,3.541,LTDuGU38-70
40,phone's launch it's kind of what they,88.17,3.03,LTDuGU38-70
41,are known for you know placing what,89.7,3.36,LTDuGU38-70
42,feels like the highest and best,91.2,3.809,LTDuGU38-70
43,available specs for the highest and,93.06,4.23,LTDuGU38-70
44,performance all-in-one phone and we,95.009,4.171,LTDuGU38-70
45,still have a very familiar oneplus,97.29,4.469,LTDuGU38-70
46,design and experience here to they still,99.18,4.17,LTDuGU38-70
47,have their logo on the back and still,101.759,3.18,LTDuGU38-70
48,things like the alert slider that I'm,103.35,3.21,LTDuGU38-70
49,surprised more phones haven't copied yet,104.939,4.171,LTDuGU38-70
50,still oxygen OS one of my favorite clean,106.56,4.68,LTDuGU38-70
51,Android skins with all of its features,109.11,4.829,LTDuGU38-70
52,oh wait stop plus what if the nitpicks,111.24,5.79,LTDuGU38-70
53,always been with oneplus phones one is,113.939,4.981,LTDuGU38-70
54,that their cameras are always just not,117.03,3.9,LTDuGU38-70
55,quite measuring up to the flagships and,118.92,4.92,LTDuGU38-70
56,to that they always tend to leave out,120.93,4.77,LTDuGU38-70
57,these sort of fringe features that don't,123.84,4.229,LTDuGU38-70
58,feel essential but still feel like you,125.7,3.57,LTDuGU38-70
59,should have them if you're gonna claim,128.069,2.791,LTDuGU38-70
60,that you're a flagship things like,129.27,4.74,LTDuGU38-70
61,wireless charging and ip68 certification,130.86,5.07,LTDuGU38-70
62,well guess what they finally went added,134.01,5.22,LTDuGU38-70
63,this year an improved camera wireless,135.93,7.02,LTDuGU38-70
64,charging and an official ip68 water and,139.23,5.88,LTDuGU38-70
65,dust resistance rating finally but you,142.95,3.42,LTDuGU38-70
66,know what let me start from the top with,145.11,3.42,LTDuGU38-70
67,a new design for the 1 plus 8 Pro you,146.37,3.929,LTDuGU38-70
68,can see it here I really like a lot of,148.53,4.049,LTDuGU38-70
69,it the new matte finish and this blue,150.299,4.261,LTDuGU38-70
70,color are pretty sick I don't have a lot,152.579,4.38,LTDuGU38-70
71,of matte blue phones but this one is,154.56,4.289,LTDuGU38-70
72,nice it's punchy and clean so it's,156.959,3.961,LTDuGU38-70
73,easily my favorite blue phone and this,158.849,3.45,LTDuGU38-70
74,finish is nice it doesn't really show,160.92,3.33,LTDuGU38-70
75,too many fingerprints of course you can,162.299,3.75,LTDuGU38-70
76,also grab this ultra matte teardown skin,164.25,3.329,LTDuGU38-70
77,from our channel sponsor D brand which,166.049,3.75,LTDuGU38-70
78,also feels great and you can see the,167.579,4.711,LTDuGU38-70
79,wireless charging coil in the back plus,169.799,3.81,LTDuGU38-70
80,it's also got a few Easter eggs hidden,172.29,3.33,LTDuGU38-70
81,in the design which are pretty dope but,173.609,3.96,LTDuGU38-70
82,anyway yeah the shape of the phone is,175.62,4.589,LTDuGU38-70
83,boxy which I've always really liked plus,177.569,4.381,LTDuGU38-70
84,there's this new little design accent,180.209,3.9,LTDuGU38-70
85,Ridge into the top of the phone so,181.95,3.599,LTDuGU38-70
86,generally I think it's one of the,184.109,3.121,LTDuGU38-70
87,absolute better-looking phones out there,185.549,4.11,LTDuGU38-70
88,but I still get to nitpick because like,187.23,4.53,LTDuGU38-70
89,I said a $900 phone that's what's gonna,189.659,2.521,LTDuGU38-70
90,happen,191.76,2.55,LTDuGU38-70
91,this camera bumped well it's not as ugly,192.18,4.139,LTDuGU38-70
92,as some of the others out there it still,194.31,4.739,LTDuGU38-70
93,is pretty big like it's annoyingly rocks,196.319,4.741,LTDuGU38-70
94,on a table big for sticking out of the,199.049,3.421,LTDuGU38-70
95,phone that much so I got to point that,201.06,3.509,LTDuGU38-70
96,out but again you can put a case on it,202.47,3.9,LTDuGU38-70
97,and get rid of that then you get a round,204.569,4.111,LTDuGU38-70
98,to the front and you're looking at the,206.37,4.47,LTDuGU38-70
99,new display which is an upgrade to,208.68,4.589,LTDuGU38-70
100,pretty much all the ways that count but,210.84,4.92,LTDuGU38-70
101,also technically technically a slight,213.269,5.25,LTDuGU38-70
102,downgrade to so this is a six point,215.76,8.099,LTDuGU38-70
103,seven eight inch 1440p 120 Hertz AMOLED,218.519,8.101,LTDuGU38-70
104,display and it's really really good one,223.859,4.59,LTDuGU38-70
105,plus and display mates say it's their,226.62,4.11,LTDuGU38-70
106,most color accurate display ever you,228.449,3.68,LTDuGU38-70
107,know the best a plus they've ever given,230.73,3.509,LTDuGU38-70
108,etc etc they're kind of starting to,232.129,3.61,LTDuGU38-70
109,sound a lot like the XO mark at this,234.239,3.601,LTDuGU38-70
110,point look I believe you the color is,235.739,3.87,LTDuGU38-70
111,great the calibration is great but what,237.84,3.66,LTDuGU38-70
112,I notice more often is number one it's,239.609,3.75,LTDuGU38-70
113,definitely a lot brighter than last year,241.5,3.599,LTDuGU38-70
114,which is sweet and then of course the,243.359,3.871,LTDuGU38-70
115,flagship feature for 2024 all these new,245.099,5.04,LTDuGU38-70
116,flagships which is the smooth 120 Hertz,247.23,6.03,LTDuGU38-70
117,refresh rate plus 240 Hertz touch,250.139,5.28,LTDuGU38-70
118,sampling rate and it is awesome I've,253.26,3.659,LTDuGU38-70
119,been looking forward to this couple,255.419,4.5,LTDuGU38-70
120,specifics on it one yes it does let you,256.919,5.581,LTDuGU38-70
121,run both high refresh rate and high,259.919,5.101,LTDuGU38-70
122,resolution at the same time and that's,262.5,5.1,LTDuGU38-70
123,exactly what I've been doing 1440p at,265.02,4.05,LTDuGU38-70
124,hundred twenty Hertz at the expense of,267.6,3.96,LTDuGU38-70
125,battery but you know live your life then,269.07,5.34,LTDuGU38-70
126,yes it is technically a variable refresh,271.56,5.25,LTDuGU38-70
127,rate so even when you have it set to 120,274.41,4.5,LTDuGU38-70
128,Hertz just like last year it will step,276.81,4.17,LTDuGU38-70
129,down to sixty Hertz occasionally when,278.91,3.21,LTDuGU38-70
130,you're just sitting around not doing,280.98,3.3,LTDuGU38-70
131,anything or if you're on a home screen,282.12,3.99,LTDuGU38-70
132,or if you're in some app that won't use,284.28,3.72,LTDuGU38-70
133,that like Waze or Google Maps or,286.11,4.44,LTDuGU38-70
134,snapchat or a game or something then yes,288.0,4.83,LTDuGU38-70
135,there is still an optical fingerprint,290.55,4.11,LTDuGU38-70
136,reader underneath that screen it doesn't,292.83,3.9,LTDuGU38-70
137,appear to be any bigger or faster but,294.66,5.46,LTDuGU38-70
138,still fairly reliable for me and yes the,296.73,6.51,LTDuGU38-70
139,edges are still curved over both sides,300.12,5.22,LTDuGU38-70
140,and this is my least favorite feature of,303.24,4.53,LTDuGU38-70
141,this display I still get accidental,305.34,4.83,LTDuGU38-70
142,touches like really I I realized the,307.77,4.8,LTDuGU38-70
143,idea is it looks cool and it's edgeless,310.17,4.35,LTDuGU38-70
144,and futuristic but I think it's time to,312.57,3.45,LTDuGU38-70
145,slow that down and I think Samsung's,314.52,3.66,LTDuGU38-70
146,perfected that balance this year between,316.02,4.5,LTDuGU38-70
147,curving the glass a little bit and still,318.18,4.08,LTDuGU38-70
148,having a flat working surface with no,320.52,3.99,LTDuGU38-70
149,accidental touches so just saying and,322.26,3.99,LTDuGU38-70
150,also by now from all these Beauty angles,324.51,3.18,LTDuGU38-70
151,of the screen certainly you've noticed,326.25,3.42,LTDuGU38-70
152,that hole-punch camera in the top left,327.69,3.84,LTDuGU38-70
153,corner for the selfie shooter for the,329.67,6.32,LTDuGU38-70
154,1+8 pro hot take the pop-up camera was,331.53,7.74,LTDuGU38-70
155,the pop up camera was better than the,335.99,5.32,LTDuGU38-70
156,hole punch and this is a downgrade like,339.27,3.48,LTDuGU38-70
157,I get that the pop up camera was a,341.31,2.85,LTDuGU38-70
158,moving part I was the first to point,342.75,3.18,LTDuGU38-70
159,that out a moving part and a phone is,344.16,3.93,LTDuGU38-70
160,always a part to pay attention to but we,345.93,3.69,LTDuGU38-70
161,haven't had any durability problems with,348.09,3.57,LTDuGU38-70
162,them for the past two years we've seen,349.62,4.62,LTDuGU38-70
163,them in phones and of course having that,351.66,4.95,LTDuGU38-70
164,part hidden inside allows you a fully,354.24,4.47,LTDuGU38-70
165,uninterrupted screen with no hole punch,356.61,4.68,LTDuGU38-70
166,and when it closes down into the phone,358.71,4.92,LTDuGU38-70
167,and you're not using it it's blocked by,361.29,3.9,LTDuGU38-70
168,the rest of the phone so that's an added,363.63,3.84,LTDuGU38-70
169,security benefit so seems like the pop,365.19,4.11,LTDuGU38-70
170,up camera was the way to go so why do,367.47,3.75,LTDuGU38-70
171,they remove the pop up camera and change,369.3,5.34,LTDuGU38-70
172,back to a hole punch I don't know maybe,371.22,5.31,LTDuGU38-70
173,to look a little bit more like the other,374.64,4.35,LTDuGU38-70
174,flagships maybe to save a little bit of,376.53,5.43,LTDuGU38-70
175,money maybe maybe to guarantee the ip68,378.99,4.89,LTDuGU38-70
176,water certification maybe just a little,381.96,3.96,LTDuGU38-70
177,bit of all these things also side note I,383.88,5.01,LTDuGU38-70
178,would like to see some of these phones,385.92,6.33,LTDuGU38-70
179,offering 120 Hertz screens also offer a,388.89,6.99,LTDuGU38-70
180,90 Hertz mode in between 60 and 120 so,392.25,5.729,LTDuGU38-70
181,we really know we can step down to 1080p,395.88,3.93,LTDuGU38-70
182,to save battery life I think it would be,397.979,3.121,LTDuGU38-70
183,nice to be able to step down,399.81,4.92,LTDuGU38-70
184,90 Hertz to save battery life - just a,401.1,5.19,LTDuGU38-70
185,an idea some of the gaming phones have,404.73,3.03,LTDuGU38-70
186,done this already but I want to see more,406.29,3.66,LTDuGU38-70
187,flagships doing it - so there's a free,407.76,4.8,LTDuGU38-70
188,idea so all of the 1+8 internal specs,409.95,5.79,LTDuGU38-70
189,are high-end top-end you know snapdragon,412.56,7.14,LTDuGU38-70
190,865 eight or twelve gigs of fast lpddr4,415.74,7.23,LTDuGU38-70
191,am it's that super fast ufs 3.0 storage,419.7,5.22,LTDuGU38-70
192,and the battery also gets an upgrade,422.97,4.14,LTDuGU38-70
193,because on top of all that it's a 5g,424.92,5.13,LTDuGU38-70
194,capable phone with 120 Hertz big display,427.11,4.71,LTDuGU38-70
195,so you get a four thousand five hundred,430.05,3.9,LTDuGU38-70
196,ten milliamp hour battery it's not the,431.82,3.72,LTDuGU38-70
197,biggest battery in the world but for me,433.95,3.48,LTDuGU38-70
198,it did just fine like I said I've been,435.54,3.66,LTDuGU38-70
199,using the phone with my high brightness,437.43,6.27,LTDuGU38-70
200,high GPS use at 1440p 120 Hertz and I've,439.2,5.85,LTDuGU38-70
201,been getting to the end of the day,443.7,3.51,LTDuGU38-70
202,pretty comfortably I could kill this,445.05,3.84,LTDuGU38-70
203,phone in a day and I've noticed that but,447.21,3.63,LTDuGU38-70
204,if I didn't want to I would step down to,448.89,3.48,LTDuGU38-70
205,1080p and I would say have a lot of,450.84,3.24,LTDuGU38-70
206,pixel pushing and a lot of battery and,452.37,3.54,LTDuGU38-70
207,that's a nice backup to have generally,454.08,3.3,LTDuGU38-70
208,for me I'm talking about like a six hour,455.91,3.24,LTDuGU38-70
209,screen on time for this phone six and a,457.38,3.18,LTDuGU38-70
210,half hours if you want to reference back,459.15,4.26,LTDuGU38-70
211,to other videos that's really good but,460.56,5.79,LTDuGU38-70
212,also something to note is for me the,463.41,5.7,LTDuGU38-70
213,charging habits of your phone can change,466.35,4.29,LTDuGU38-70
214,what you think of the battery and,469.11,4.41,LTDuGU38-70
215,oneplus phones are known for having fast,470.64,4.86,LTDuGU38-70
216,charging this one's no exception you,473.52,4.32,LTDuGU38-70
217,still have their high speed warp charge,475.5,5.49,LTDuGU38-70
218,30t comes in the box and that can get,477.84,5.49,LTDuGU38-70
219,you from 0 to half battery in like 25,480.99,4.01,LTDuGU38-70
220,minutes but what's new to this phone is,483.33,4.86,LTDuGU38-70
221,wireless charging finally oneplus is,485.0,5.32,LTDuGU38-70
222,putting the little charging coil behind,488.19,3.66,LTDuGU38-70
223,the glass back and enabling wireless,490.32,3.42,LTDuGU38-70
224,charging and on top of all that even,491.85,4.53,LTDuGU38-70
225,better it's fast wireless charging so 30,493.74,5.46,LTDuGU38-70
226,watt wireless charging is what they're,496.38,5.22,LTDuGU38-70
227,claiming and sharing with everyone which,499.2,4.68,LTDuGU38-70
228,is really nice that's fast that's gonna,501.6,5.07,LTDuGU38-70
229,top up from 0 to half battery in half an,503.88,3.17,LTDuGU38-70
230,hour,506.67,5.67,LTDuGU38-70
231,but there's a catch you only get fast 30,507.05,6.97,LTDuGU38-70
232,watt wireless charging with this phone,512.34,7.55,LTDuGU38-70
233,with this exact brand new $70 oneplus,514.02,8.91,LTDuGU38-70
234,wireless charging stand you need this,519.89,5.2,LTDuGU38-70
235,accessory to get 30 watts wireless,522.93,4.14,LTDuGU38-70
236,charging on the spot and that's because,525.09,6.09,LTDuGU38-70
237,it is not 30 watts of purely qi wireless,527.07,5.88,LTDuGU38-70
238,charging so oneplus has worked on this,531.18,3.07,LTDuGU38-70
239,special high-end why,532.95,3.13,LTDuGU38-70
240,charging tech and to be fair it works,534.25,4.05,LTDuGU38-70
241,exactly as advertised the stand is nice,536.08,4.83,LTDuGU38-70
242,it has some little quiet fans in there,538.3,5.07,LTDuGU38-70
243,and it does some special voltage and,540.91,4.65,LTDuGU38-70
244,thermal management to get the peak 30,543.37,4.53,LTDuGU38-70
245,watts wireless charging out of it but if,545.56,4.71,LTDuGU38-70
246,you put another Qi enabled phone on that,547.9,4.59,LTDuGU38-70
247,wireless charger it charges slower and,550.27,5.16,LTDuGU38-70
248,if you put the 1+8 pro on any other qi,552.49,5.13,LTDuGU38-70
249,wireless charger it charges slower,555.43,4.71,LTDuGU38-70
250,because that tech was proprietary so the,557.62,4.98,LTDuGU38-70
251,oneplus 8 pro still supports regular qi,560.14,4.65,LTDuGU38-70
252,wireless charging but only universally,562.6,5.82,LTDuGU38-70
253,at five watts which is pretty slow it's,564.79,6.39,LTDuGU38-70
254,not it's I mean it works but it's like,568.42,5.64,LTDuGU38-70
255,it's pretty slow so for me I'm not gonna,571.18,4.5,LTDuGU38-70
256,replace that you can't see it but I'm,574.06,3.21,LTDuGU38-70
257,not gonna replace the wireless charger,575.68,4.23,LTDuGU38-70
258,at my desk with the oneplus one because,577.27,5.64,LTDuGU38-70
259,I have other Qi accessories like my ear,579.91,5.43,LTDuGU38-70
260,pods Pro or my iPhone or literally any,582.91,4.53,LTDuGU38-70
261,other Qi phone that I want to charge,585.34,5.25,LTDuGU38-70
262,faster wirelessly so I'm just gonna,587.44,5.49,LTDuGU38-70
263,stick to Wired warp charging in the car,590.59,4.14,LTDuGU38-70
264,and pretty much everywhere I need it but,592.93,4.32,LTDuGU38-70
265,at home I have a pixel stand at my desk,594.73,4.71,LTDuGU38-70
266,and I can just leave it there to slowly,597.25,3.96,LTDuGU38-70
267,top-up over night and wake up with a,599.44,3.78,LTDuGU38-70
268,hundred percent so I'm glad to have,601.21,3.72,LTDuGU38-70
269,wireless charging but there is that,603.22,3.69,LTDuGU38-70
270,little snag so then there are the,604.93,4.32,LTDuGU38-70
271,cameras quad cameras on the back of this,606.91,4.2,LTDuGU38-70
272,phone and here are the numbers which,609.25,4.08,LTDuGU38-70
273,maybe mean less than ever these days but,611.11,4.35,LTDuGU38-70
274,it's a new forty eight megapixel main,613.33,4.8,LTDuGU38-70
275,camera with oh is then there's a forty,615.46,4.5,LTDuGU38-70
276,eight megapixel ultra wide with macro,618.13,4.47,LTDuGU38-70
277,mode which fun fact is the same sensor,619.96,5.28,LTDuGU38-70
278,as the primary camera from the oneplus 7,622.6,4.86,LTDuGU38-70
279,pro then there's a 3x telephoto camera,625.24,4.32,LTDuGU38-70
280,and believe it or not the fourth one is,627.46,4.92,LTDuGU38-70
281,a five megapixel color filter camera so,629.56,4.2,LTDuGU38-70
282,that's your array and I'll just go ahead,632.38,3.27,LTDuGU38-70
283,and say it the oneplus 8 pro is a,633.76,4.47,LTDuGU38-70
284,flagship quality camera right in line,635.65,6.03,LTDuGU38-70
285,with galaxy s 20 and Huawei P 40 and,638.23,6.74,LTDuGU38-70
286,just short of the pixel and the iPhone,641.68,5.85,LTDuGU38-70
287,there I said it it's spitting out sharp,644.97,4.84,LTDuGU38-70
288,12 megapixel images with nice dynamic,647.53,4.8,LTDuGU38-70
289,range and colors a bit overexposed,649.81,4.32,LTDuGU38-70
290,sometimes that's where it misses but,652.33,4.11,LTDuGU38-70
291,generally these are nice photos also,654.13,3.87,LTDuGU38-70
292,sorry in advance for slightly less,656.44,3.72,LTDuGU38-70
293,outdoor photos the whole,658.0,4.32,LTDuGU38-70
294,shelter-in-place Quarantine thing,660.16,3.9,LTDuGU38-70
295,clearly means I also have less people,662.32,4.29,LTDuGU38-70
296,subjects but yeah you can tell this is,664.06,3.51,LTDuGU38-70
297,an confid,666.61,3.45,LTDuGU38-70
298,nice camera no autofocus issues at all,667.57,4.11,LTDuGU38-70
299,especially when you give it some light,670.06,3.6,LTDuGU38-70
300,and even sometimes when you don't it's,671.68,4.68,LTDuGU38-70
301,nice I like it you are still gonna get,673.66,5.369,LTDuGU38-70
302,more fringing with close-up subjects I,676.36,4.44,LTDuGU38-70
303,take a lot of close-ups subject photos,679.029,3.271,LTDuGU38-70
304,and that's the downside of a big one,680.8,4.2,LTDuGU38-70
305,over 1.4 inch sensor but again that just,682.3,4.08,LTDuGU38-70
306,seems like par for the course for,685.0,3.06,LTDuGU38-70
307,flagship cameras right now,686.38,4.709,LTDuGU38-70
308,big sensor usually sharp photos but get,688.06,4.44,LTDuGU38-70
309,some fringing when your photos are,691.089,3.541,LTDuGU38-70
310,close-up subjects the night mode is,692.5,3.6,LTDuGU38-70
311,pretty good which is nice,694.63,4.47,LTDuGU38-70
312,max zoom is 30 X from that telephoto,696.1,5.039,LTDuGU38-70
313,camera I don't think it's very usable at,699.1,5.039,LTDuGU38-70
314,30 X it's barely passable galaxy s 20,701.139,4.651,LTDuGU38-70
315,Ultra is still gonna be the zoom champ,704.139,4.2,LTDuGU38-70
316,for that sort of range but tight 10x is,705.79,6.029,LTDuGU38-70
317,fine and 3x is definitely usable and I,708.339,5.461,LTDuGU38-70
318,have pretty much no use for the head,711.819,4.26,LTDuGU38-70
319,color filter camera the selfie camera,713.8,4.14,LTDuGU38-70
320,you guys have asked for it I usually,716.079,3.51,LTDuGU38-70
321,don't get too into the selfie camera in,717.94,3.66,LTDuGU38-70
322,smartphones but I'll do it I'll start,719.589,3.391,LTDuGU38-70
323,taking selfies now it's part of the job,721.6,3.96,LTDuGU38-70
324,and I gotta say this one still seems to,722.98,5.279,LTDuGU38-70
325,struggle with proper exposure and maybe,725.56,4.05,LTDuGU38-70
326,that's gonna happen more for people with,728.259,3.961,LTDuGU38-70
327,darker skin like myself but other than,729.61,4.68,LTDuGU38-70
328,that it's still looking pretty good with,732.22,5.01,LTDuGU38-70
329,detail and video from this camera is,734.29,4.71,LTDuGU38-70
330,also good especially with color and,737.23,4.89,LTDuGU38-70
331,stabilization at 4k and you can see no,739.0,5.399,LTDuGU38-70
332,8k video here but you know you're not,742.12,3.719,LTDuGU38-70
333,touching the iPhone when it comes to the,744.399,3.331,LTDuGU38-70
334,absolute best video quality in a phone,745.839,3.69,LTDuGU38-70
335,right now but this is still good,747.73,3.719,LTDuGU38-70
336,flagship quality color me impressed,749.529,3.451,LTDuGU38-70
337,I think god I think some people took me,751.449,3.961,LTDuGU38-70
338,saying that the camera was the worst,752.98,5.159,LTDuGU38-70
339,part of the phone last year as like some,755.41,5.25,LTDuGU38-70
340,sort of horrific flaw in it when really,758.139,4.021,LTDuGU38-70
341,it was like the rest of the phone was so,760.66,4.35,LTDuGU38-70
342,incredibly good that feat ok camera was,762.16,5.429,LTDuGU38-70
343,the downside but again now we're looking,765.01,4.74,LTDuGU38-70
344,at a flagship quality camera and they've,767.589,4.291,LTDuGU38-70
345,also been notoriously pretty good with,769.75,4.17,LTDuGU38-70
346,updating them over time and getting,771.88,4.23,LTDuGU38-70
347,better with camera quality that's been,773.92,4.109,LTDuGU38-70
348,nice plus they're probably a G cam mod,776.11,4.2,LTDuGU38-70
349,in the next couple weeks hopefully if,778.029,5.461,LTDuGU38-70
350,you want those sweet pixel contrast II,780.31,6.209,LTDuGU38-70
351,photos so yeah thumbs up on the camera,783.49,4.469,LTDuGU38-70
352,and then one plus phones have long been,786.519,3.031,LTDuGU38-70
353,some of my favorites specifically,787.959,3.81,LTDuGU38-70
354,because of the software and optimized,789.55,4.769,LTDuGU38-70
355,experience this is oxygen OS on top of,791.769,4.981,LTDuGU38-70
356,Android 10 and that's no exception here,794.319,4.051,LTDuGU38-70
357,for this phone there's tons of little,796.75,3.91,LTDuGU38-70
358,tweaks and optimizations and,798.37,4.12,LTDuGU38-70
359,provements and little tightened up,800.66,3.96,LTDuGU38-70
360,animations all over the place but it,802.49,3.899,LTDuGU38-70
361,never feels overloaded like some other,804.62,4.11,LTDuGU38-70
362,overlays actually removed the oxygen OS,806.389,4.291,LTDuGU38-70
363,shelf to the left of the home screen and,808.73,3.719,LTDuGU38-70
364,it's just Google's Discoverer page now,810.68,4.529,LTDuGU38-70
365,like a pixel and there's really high,812.449,5.01,LTDuGU38-70
366,quality haptics in this phone again I,815.209,4.261,LTDuGU38-70
367,love that and then in software there's,817.459,3.601,LTDuGU38-70
368,just a couple new software features here,819.47,2.549,LTDuGU38-70
369,and there that are nicely executed,821.06,4.86,LTDuGU38-70
370,there's a new dark mode 2.0 theme some,822.019,5.791,LTDuGU38-70
371,new dynamic wallpapers tucked in there,825.92,3.63,LTDuGU38-70
372,and just a lot of aesthetic tweaks,827.81,3.3,LTDuGU38-70
373,generally but they do a good job of not,829.55,4.86,LTDuGU38-70
374,feeling overly cartoony and then there's,831.11,6.63,LTDuGU38-70
375,a new motion graphic smoothing toggle,834.41,6.09,LTDuGU38-70
376,that works with certain apps you can see,837.74,4.469,LTDuGU38-70
377,the whole compatibility list here from,840.5,3.66,LTDuGU38-70
378,my phone and it worked pretty well when,842.209,3.601,LTDuGU38-70
379,I tried it for like two minutes but I,844.16,4.109,LTDuGU38-70
380,feel like I'm against motion smoothing,845.81,6.0,LTDuGU38-70
381,like on principle at my core so I turned,848.269,4.92,LTDuGU38-70
382,that off pretty quick but you might,851.81,2.819,LTDuGU38-70
383,remember that what's on my phone video,853.189,3.57,LTDuGU38-70
384,with the galaxy s 20 where I go through,854.629,3.63,LTDuGU38-70
385,all the things that I do that the little,856.759,3.361,LTDuGU38-70
386,subtle software tweaks to really make it,858.259,4.38,LTDuGU38-70
387,my daily driver and make it behave the,860.12,4.86,LTDuGU38-70
388,way I want that list of things is so,862.639,4.68,LTDuGU38-70
389,much shorter on a phone like the oneplus,864.98,6.15,LTDuGU38-70
390,8 pro or a pixel and I yeah this this is,867.319,5.281,LTDuGU38-70
391,gonna be my new daily driver so long,871.13,2.759,LTDuGU38-70
392,story short they finally made a flagship,872.6,2.94,LTDuGU38-70
393,they finally did it they're charging,873.889,3.3,LTDuGU38-70
394,flagship money and they're offering,875.54,3.63,LTDuGU38-70
395,pretty much everything a flagship would,877.189,3.96,LTDuGU38-70
396,in a bonafide,879.17,5.159,LTDuGU38-70
397,complete kind of predictable feeling way,881.149,4.891,LTDuGU38-70
398,but still it's what we're looking,884.329,2.94,LTDuGU38-70
399,forward to matter of fact let me put my,886.04,3.719,LTDuGU38-70
400,predictions down for the one plus eight,887.269,5.49,LTDuGU38-70
401,T pro that'll probably come out in like,889.759,4.5,LTDuGU38-70
402,six to eight months you're probably,892.759,5.31,LTDuGU38-70
403,looking at snapdragon 865 plus maybe a,894.259,6.991,LTDuGU38-70
404,little extra RAM probably faster,898.069,5.49,LTDuGU38-70
405,charging faster qi wireless charging I,901.25,4.139,LTDuGU38-70
406,also think maybe they could use a little,903.559,3.78,LTDuGU38-70
407,bit of a darker coating on the selfie,905.389,4.351,LTDuGU38-70
408,camera up in the corner and maybe a,907.339,4.531,LTDuGU38-70
409,special McLaren Edition phone and that's,909.74,4.199,LTDuGU38-70
410,it but in the meantime this becomes one,911.87,3.54,LTDuGU38-70
411,of the easiest phones to recommend,913.939,4.02,LTDuGU38-70
412,period even though it's the most,915.41,4.71,LTDuGU38-70
413,expensive one plus phone ever which is a,917.959,4.291,LTDuGU38-70
414,nice headline to write it still,920.12,3.719,LTDuGU38-70
415,undercuts a lot of the other flagships,922.25,3.99,LTDuGU38-70
416,that it's now at feature parity with and,923.839,3.571,LTDuGU38-70
417,I think this is definitely the one you,926.24,3.42,LTDuGU38-70
418,should pick of those either way that's,927.41,4.649,LTDuGU38-70
419,been it thanks for watching catch you,929.66,5.929,LTDuGU38-70
420,guys in the next one peace,932.059,3.53,LTDuGU38-70
0,oK you've seen the title these are the,0.03,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
1,two highest end 2020 flag ships from 1,1.56,4.65,MHWnTJwxsKM
2,plus and samsung I've used both for a,3.78,4.35,MHWnTJwxsKM
3,fair bit of time now and today we're,6.21,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
4,going to declare a Android smartphone,8.13,4.11,MHWnTJwxsKM
5,king also alongside this video I've,9.96,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
6,launched another one comparing the,12.24,3.809,MHWnTJwxsKM
7,normal 1 plus 8 with Apple's iPhone 11,13.62,3.989,MHWnTJwxsKM
8,because that phone was basically built,16.049,3.39,MHWnTJwxsKM
9,to be an iPhone killer,17.609,3.481,MHWnTJwxsKM
10,so after you've seen this one then do,19.439,3.271,MHWnTJwxsKM
11,check that one out too in case you're,21.09,3.21,MHWnTJwxsKM
12,wondering this is the package oneplus,22.71,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
13,sent out to me it's the media kit which,24.3,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
14,has a few cool things inside for,26.67,4.019,MHWnTJwxsKM
15,starters a beefy reviewers guide I'm,28.47,4.95,MHWnTJwxsKM
16,talking a 60 page read over here and 2,30.689,4.921,MHWnTJwxsKM
17,official cases one is the sunstone,33.42,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
18,bumper which I mean it feels ok solid,35.61,4.289,MHWnTJwxsKM
19,all run protection with a textured,38.04,3.48,MHWnTJwxsKM
20,finish on both the outside and inside,39.899,4.561,MHWnTJwxsKM
21,but it is just a sheet of plastic the,41.52,5.1,MHWnTJwxsKM
22,second though is the carbon bumper which,44.46,4.439,MHWnTJwxsKM
23,i think is slightly nicer it's part TPU,46.62,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
24,and pot' Kevlar,48.899,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
25,it still feels slim and light but does,50.37,2.939,MHWnTJwxsKM
26,have a nice matte finish on the outside,52.079,4.531,MHWnTJwxsKM
27,texture on the inside and finally this,53.309,5.461,MHWnTJwxsKM
28,is the retail box the phone so if you,56.61,4.019,MHWnTJwxsKM
29,hopped into a store right now well this,58.77,3.809,MHWnTJwxsKM
30,is the box you'd get and I would go as,60.629,3.42,MHWnTJwxsKM
31,far as to say that the combination of,62.579,3.451,MHWnTJwxsKM
32,what it looks like and what you get in,64.049,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
33,here makes this one of my favorite boxes,66.03,3.87,MHWnTJwxsKM
34,and ever the phone is on top and below,67.979,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
35,that you get this elongated insert which,69.9,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
36,has a couple of cool things inside some,71.909,3.6,MHWnTJwxsKM
37,information cards a sheet of oneplus,73.83,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
38,stickers and the invitation letter which,75.509,3.811,MHWnTJwxsKM
39,has the similar typical attached on to,77.34,3.419,MHWnTJwxsKM
40,it this is just basically one plus,79.32,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
41,saying hi there yeah thanks for buying,80.759,4.381,MHWnTJwxsKM
42,me there's more though I'm a big fan of,83.07,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
43,this case they've added in there it's,85.14,4.409,MHWnTJwxsKM
44,not just some lazy generic TPU sheet,86.85,5.01,MHWnTJwxsKM
45,it's got the never settle slogan in Vic,89.549,4.351,MHWnTJwxsKM
46,text it's got a matte finish on the,91.86,4.41,MHWnTJwxsKM
47,rails texture on the inside and a little,93.9,5.219,MHWnTJwxsKM
48,designed by 1 plus text there's a USBC,96.27,5.309,MHWnTJwxsKM
49,cable for charging and a 30 watt warp,99.119,4.86,MHWnTJwxsKM
50,charger this is fast the eagle-eyed,101.579,3.961,MHWnTJwxsKM
51,among you might have noticed that,103.979,3.451,MHWnTJwxsKM
52,oneplus is actually branded since their,105.54,3.869,MHWnTJwxsKM
53,last phone everything is now in all caps,107.43,4.71,MHWnTJwxsKM
54,with a slightly bolder logo anyways,109.409,4.35,MHWnTJwxsKM
55,holding these two phones together you'll,112.14,3.39,MHWnTJwxsKM
56,notice something the oneplus 8 pro is a,113.759,3.811,MHWnTJwxsKM
57,big phone but Samsung is a slightly,115.53,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
58,bigger in every dimension you'll almost,117.57,4.049,MHWnTJwxsKM
59,miss it at a glance but because it's,119.82,3.839,MHWnTJwxsKM
60,bigger from all angles it's taller,121.619,4.471,MHWnTJwxsKM
61,thicker heavier wider and so when you,123.659,3.871,MHWnTJwxsKM
62,add all those together this feels like a,126.09,3.029,MHWnTJwxsKM
63,middleweight versus heavy weight,127.53,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
64,situation like no one ever wants to drop,129.119,3.631,MHWnTJwxsKM
65,their phone on their face when they're,131.37,2.43,MHWnTJwxsKM
66,scrolling embedded,132.75,2.94,MHWnTJwxsKM
67,right but I get the feeling that if you,133.8,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
68,did do that with this phone you'd be out,135.69,4.86,MHWnTJwxsKM
69,for a few days and as a result almost by,138.09,4.71,MHWnTJwxsKM
70,default oneplus is the more ergonomic,140.55,4.71,MHWnTJwxsKM
71,palm friendly offering but on top of,142.8,4.59,MHWnTJwxsKM
72,that it's smaller dimensions are,145.26,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
73,combined with a slightly curved back and,147.39,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
74,a matte finish if you go for the top-end,149.43,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
75,model this I'm phone off in the UK at,151.35,3.99,MHWnTJwxsKM
76,least the two color options you get are,153.81,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
77,glossy black and this greeny blue color,155.34,5.04,MHWnTJwxsKM
78,bordering on being a little plain for,158.43,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
79,still it's done well and some color is,160.38,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
80,still better than no color like the,162.81,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
81,Samsung which comes in either black or,164.55,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
82,this exciting gray color,166.32,3.6,MHWnTJwxsKM
83,oh yeah and neither phone has a,168.3,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
84,headphone jack but oneplus does have a,169.92,3.81,MHWnTJwxsKM
85,dedicated slider for switching between,171.87,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
86,ring vibrate and silent,173.73,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
87,the only real design negative for,176.01,4.41,MHWnTJwxsKM
88,oneplus is the enormous camera bump it,177.87,3.72,MHWnTJwxsKM
89,was pretty much my first observation,180.42,3.27,MHWnTJwxsKM
90,when I took the phone out the box but,181.59,4.41,MHWnTJwxsKM
91,let's not forget Samsung sticks out just,183.69,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
92,as much but it's wider too if you're,186.0,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
93,going to use a case neither of these is,188.01,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
94,a big deal because they'll even out the,189.63,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
95,back but if you're going there the,191.46,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
96,protrusions on either side are enough,193.59,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
97,that you can't really use these phones,195.39,3.99,MHWnTJwxsKM
98,sitting on a flat surface okay anyways,197.22,3.9,MHWnTJwxsKM
99,the traditional oneplus smartphone,199.38,3.9,MHWnTJwxsKM
100,strategy has always been to cut a few,201.12,4.05,MHWnTJwxsKM
101,corners to make a firm that is nearly as,203.28,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
102,good as the top level flagship ferns but,205.17,4.8,MHWnTJwxsKM
103,much cheaper that's changing this time,207.12,4.74,MHWnTJwxsKM
104,round the oneplus 8 pro is edging ever,209.97,4.019,MHWnTJwxsKM
105,closer to costing as much as a flagship,211.86,5.01,MHWnTJwxsKM
106,I'll come to this but now with little if,213.989,5.761,MHWnTJwxsKM
107,any compromise for example past oneplus,216.87,4.8,MHWnTJwxsKM
108,phones they skipped an IP rating they,219.75,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
109,skipped wireless charging but now you've,221.67,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
110,got both and in fact one plus wireless,223.32,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
111,charging has gone from being,225.42,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
112,non-existent to now actually a head of,226.5,4.68,MHWnTJwxsKM
113,Samsung's it can charge with 30 watts of,229.05,4.47,MHWnTJwxsKM
114,power versus 15 on the ultra and,231.18,5.4,MHWnTJwxsKM
115,displays Samsung really is the one to,233.52,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
116,beat when it comes to smartphone screens,236.58,4.11,MHWnTJwxsKM
117,but for my preferences at least I would,238.14,4.47,MHWnTJwxsKM
118,go as far as to say that oneplus has,240.69,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
119,actually just done that they're similar,242.61,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
120,screens both friends actually use a,244.35,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
121,display made by Samsung they both have,246.12,5.01,MHWnTJwxsKM
122,insanely high quad HD plus resolutions,248.67,5.58,MHWnTJwxsKM
123,AMOLED technology for deep contrast 120,251.13,4.919,MHWnTJwxsKM
124,Hertz refresh rates for liquid smooth,254.25,3.9,MHWnTJwxsKM
125,performance and built in technologies to,256.049,3.991,MHWnTJwxsKM
126,reduce the amount of blue light emitted,258.15,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
127,which is just better for your sleep,260.04,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
128,cycle a similar size to is six point,261.6,4.25,MHWnTJwxsKM
129,seven eight inches versus six point,264.0,4.82,MHWnTJwxsKM
130,9 inches but a few differences and the,265.85,5.22,MHWnTJwxsKM
131,key one for me actually being brightness,268.82,3.9,MHWnTJwxsKM
132,I always couldn't believe it the one,271.07,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
133,plus looks significantly brighter than,272.72,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
134,Samsung's I've tried indoor I've tried,274.64,3.81,MHWnTJwxsKM
135,out door the same result we're talking a,276.56,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
136,screen so bright that sometimes I would,278.45,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
137,find myself not bothering to use the,280.01,3.6,MHWnTJwxsKM
138,torch but instead of just turning my,281.9,3.36,MHWnTJwxsKM
139,phone around and using the display oh,283.61,3.39,MHWnTJwxsKM
140,yeah and one plus can keep running a,285.26,3.87,MHWnTJwxsKM
141,quad HD plus resolution whilst having,287.0,4.26,MHWnTJwxsKM
142,it's 120 Hertz refresh rate on with,289.13,4.02,MHWnTJwxsKM
143,Samsung it's a case of deciding do I,291.26,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
144,want an ultra sharp display or do I want,293.15,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
145,an ultra smooth display and on top of,295.22,4.59,MHWnTJwxsKM
146,that yes there is more want less claims,296.84,4.74,MHWnTJwxsKM
147,they further extend their lead with,299.81,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
148,something called M EMC technology it's a,301.58,3.99,MHWnTJwxsKM
149,piece of software that tries to combat,304.1,3.21,MHWnTJwxsKM
150,the fact that we've got displays here,305.57,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
151,that refresh 120 times per second and,307.31,5.31,MHWnTJwxsKM
152,yet most videos are filmed at 24 or 30,309.53,5.04,MHWnTJwxsKM
153,so when you're using certain apps like,312.62,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
154,YouTube on this version it can actually,314.57,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
155,insert extra frames to make the video,316.31,4.53,MHWnTJwxsKM
156,appear smoother but after a bit I turn,318.35,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
157,the feature off it causes extra battery,320.84,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
158,drain and to be honest while it does,322.67,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
159,look beautiful on videos that are,324.5,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
160,already filmed at say 60 frames per,326.18,3.48,MHWnTJwxsKM
161,second what is trying to upscale videos,327.95,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
162,that are filmed at like 24 or 30 the end,329.66,3.99,MHWnTJwxsKM
163,results framerate is kind of all over,332.09,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
164,the place it kind of judders both phones,333.65,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
165,have an almost identically sized hole,336.26,3.87,MHWnTJwxsKM
166,punch do you want it on the side or do,338.03,3.21,MHWnTJwxsKM
167,you want it in the middle it is,340.13,2.73,MHWnTJwxsKM
168,completely up to you,341.24,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
169,me personally I'm a corner hole kind of,342.86,4.98,MHWnTJwxsKM
170,guy you lose symmetry but it means that,345.56,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
171,when you watch videos the hole punch,347.84,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
172,kind of disappears generally when you're,349.25,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
173,watching something your eyes are kind of,351.29,3.54,MHWnTJwxsKM
174,focused on the center of your screen so,352.76,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
175,if you have a corner hole punch it's,354.83,3.54,MHWnTJwxsKM
176,kind of further into your peripheral,356.42,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
177,vision the last thing I did notice is,358.37,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
178,the extra curve you get on the 8 pro's,360.35,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
179,display which for the most part is just,362.69,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
180,a subjective thing but I will say that,364.64,3.72,MHWnTJwxsKM
181,it's just enough of a curve that in some,366.62,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
182,rare cases when I was holding the phone,368.36,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
183,with one hand my other fingers would be,370.37,3.9,MHWnTJwxsKM
184,triggering the edges and this doesn't,372.14,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
185,seem to happen on the Samsung and one,374.27,3.42,MHWnTJwxsKM
186,thing I've really got a hand to Samsung,375.8,3.48,MHWnTJwxsKM
187,is the fact that in the last few years,377.69,3.27,MHWnTJwxsKM
188,they've brought their phones up from,379.28,3.12,MHWnTJwxsKM
189,being some of the more bloated and,380.96,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
190,sluggish offerings to actually some of,382.4,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
191,the snappiest 1 plus used to have a very,384.14,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
192,clear speed and actually even battery,386.24,4.23,MHWnTJwxsKM
193,advantage but I think it's starting to,388.46,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
194,fade and let me be very clear this is,390.47,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
195,not a case of one-plus getting slower by,392.24,3.27,MHWnTJwxsKM
196,any stretch of the imagination,394.1,3.81,MHWnTJwxsKM
197,v8 Pro is blistering fast it's just a,395.51,3.899,MHWnTJwxsKM
198,case that actually Samsung has caught,397.91,3.689,MHWnTJwxsKM
199,and we're at a stage where I really,399.409,3.24,MHWnTJwxsKM
200,can't tell much of a difference between,401.599,2.79,MHWnTJwxsKM
201,them anymore both phones have those,402.649,4.02,MHWnTJwxsKM
202,ultra fluid 120 Hertz displays and,404.389,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
203,pretty much the best specs you can hope,406.669,4.441,MHWnTJwxsKM
204,for top-end chipsets a ton of RAM up to,408.349,5.52,MHWnTJwxsKM
205,12 gigs on oneplus and 16 on Samsung and,411.11,5.909,MHWnTJwxsKM
206,fast u FS 3.0 storage the only caveat,413.869,4.98,MHWnTJwxsKM
207,with the Samsung is and we've gone,417.019,3.24,MHWnTJwxsKM
208,through this is the fact that there's,418.849,2.46,MHWnTJwxsKM
209,two different versions of the phone,420.259,3.0,MHWnTJwxsKM
210,depending on which region you're in and,421.309,3.301,MHWnTJwxsKM
211,long story short if you get the,423.259,2.97,MHWnTJwxsKM
212,Snapdragon version in your region you,424.61,3.449,MHWnTJwxsKM
213,get to go this is a really fantastically,426.229,3.54,MHWnTJwxsKM
214,performing phone but if you get the,428.059,5.1,MHWnTJwxsKM
215,Exynos version and not so much but the,429.769,5.22,MHWnTJwxsKM
216,full detail is linked somewhere here so,433.159,3.3,MHWnTJwxsKM
217,you can check that up I guess the point,434.989,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
218,here is that no matter what region,436.459,2.97,MHWnTJwxsKM
219,you're in with the oneplus you'll get,438.169,3.33,MHWnTJwxsKM
220,the better Snapdragon chip even the,439.429,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
221,speakers on the oneplus a top level this,441.499,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
222,is another corner the company has,443.809,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
223,historically cut but not anymore you get,445.069,5.22,MHWnTJwxsKM
224,one on the front on bottom vocals and,447.739,5.16,MHWnTJwxsKM
225,instrumentals just sounded so crisp and,450.289,4.59,MHWnTJwxsKM
226,I would say the volume is comparable,452.899,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
227,between the two so at this stage it's,454.879,3.36,MHWnTJwxsKM
228,starting to seem a little bit like a,457.069,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
229,homerun for one plus it seems as if it,458.239,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
230,does pretty much everything the s20,460.999,3.21,MHWnTJwxsKM
231,ultra does but just at least as good or,462.379,4.5,MHWnTJwxsKM
232,better and it's far cheaper so does the,464.209,5.31,MHWnTJwxsKM
233,s20 ultra even have a place well the one,466.879,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
234,area where I can see oneplus two saved,469.519,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
235,some money versus Samsung is the camera,471.169,4.08,MHWnTJwxsKM
236,system and so while Samsung has a,473.659,4.081,MHWnTJwxsKM
237,massive 108 megapixel main sensor,475.249,5.13,MHWnTJwxsKM
238,oneplus has a smaller 48 megapixel one,477.74,4.289,MHWnTJwxsKM
239,it's a new sensor it's an improvement,480.379,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
240,from last gen but not as good as,482.029,3.0,MHWnTJwxsKM
241,Samsung's something has a,483.829,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
242,high-resolution telephoto camera that,485.029,4.26,MHWnTJwxsKM
243,you do 10 times hybrid zoom what Plus,487.009,4.59,MHWnTJwxsKM
244,can do three times hybrid zoom and they,489.289,4.08,MHWnTJwxsKM
245,both have pretty comparable ultra white,491.599,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
246,cameras but this is where it gets weird,493.369,4.2,MHWnTJwxsKM
247,these are both quad camera systems,495.289,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
248,Samsung's forth is a time-of-flight,497.569,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
249,camera to detect depth but oneplus is,499.429,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
250,fourth is something called a color,502.189,4.111,MHWnTJwxsKM
251,filter camera or in other words a camera,503.599,4.02,MHWnTJwxsKM
252,that can view the world in a slightly,506.3,3.0,MHWnTJwxsKM
253,different way and I'll give it this it,507.619,3.72,MHWnTJwxsKM
254,has been fun walking around and just,509.3,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
255,seeing how different normal day-to-day,511.339,4.411,MHWnTJwxsKM
256,objects look but honestly I have really,512.99,4.319,MHWnTJwxsKM
257,tried to give this thing a chance and I,515.75,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
258,just don't get it it doesn't make any,517.309,4.02,MHWnTJwxsKM
259,sense to me the camera is low resolution,518.93,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
260,and it doesn't let nearly as much light,521.329,3.211,MHWnTJwxsKM
261,in as your main camera in a best-case,522.86,3.539,MHWnTJwxsKM
262,scenario your outputs gonna look like a,524.54,4.049,MHWnTJwxsKM
263,really old film and in worst case it'll,526.399,3.601,MHWnTJwxsKM
264,just look like something's gone wrong,528.589,2.971,MHWnTJwxsKM
265,maybe someone will,530.0,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
266,really cool views for it but considering,531.56,3.719,MHWnTJwxsKM
267,that in my briefing of the phone the,533.66,3.15,MHWnTJwxsKM
268,company barely touched on it and,535.279,3.391,MHWnTJwxsKM
269,considering that the setting for using,536.81,3.33,MHWnTJwxsKM
270,this camera is hidden away in the,538.67,2.28,MHWnTJwxsKM
271,filters menu,540.14,2.67,MHWnTJwxsKM
272,it suggests that oneplus isn't that,540.95,3.03,MHWnTJwxsKM
273,confident in it either,542.81,2.969,MHWnTJwxsKM
274,that said I spent most of my time with,543.98,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
275,oneplus camera actually just being taken,545.779,3.871,MHWnTJwxsKM
276,aback at how much they've improved the,547.76,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
277,rest of it it may be cheaper hardware,549.65,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
278,than what's on Samsung's but in almost,551.45,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
279,every situation the output is at least,553.43,4.47,MHWnTJwxsKM
280,as good Paswan plus phones had some,555.77,4.56,MHWnTJwxsKM
281,potentially wonky color processing none,557.9,4.02,MHWnTJwxsKM
282,of that here photos look true to life,560.33,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
283,and crispy with nice depth of field,561.92,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
284,thanks to a pretty large sensor and,564.11,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
285,video the video colors and the dynamic,565.88,4.98,MHWnTJwxsKM
286,range are stunning and lifelike it feels,568.4,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
287,like oneplus has gone right back to the,570.86,3.419,MHWnTJwxsKM
288,drawing board and built a completely new,572.36,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
289,color processing algorithm that just,574.279,2.581,MHWnTJwxsKM
290,works,576.02,3.33,MHWnTJwxsKM
291,monie current gripe is that while yes,576.86,4.77,MHWnTJwxsKM
292,that dynamic range is gorgeous the,579.35,4.98,MHWnTJwxsKM
293,focusing is not or at least it isn't yet,581.63,4.68,MHWnTJwxsKM
294,and funnily enough it just so happens,584.33,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
295,that this is also an issue for Samsung,586.31,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
296,but detail camera comparison coming very,588.02,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
297,soon so if you could subscribe to that,589.97,4.2,MHWnTJwxsKM
298,that would be amazing a few final things,591.8,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
299,to note both have in display fingerprint,594.17,4.68,MHWnTJwxsKM
300,scanners and dual SIM functionality but,596.42,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
301,with the Samsung you can actually use,598.85,3.03,MHWnTJwxsKM
302,one of those SIM card slots to double as,600.11,4.44,MHWnTJwxsKM
303,extra expandable storage I also slightly,601.88,4.47,MHWnTJwxsKM
304,prefer the haptic engine on the ultra,604.55,4.05,MHWnTJwxsKM
305,but you get good general vibration,606.35,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
306,feedback on both and in terms of,608.6,3.09,MHWnTJwxsKM
307,charging speeds you won't have a problem,610.1,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
308,whichever way you turn here the crucial,611.69,3.99,MHWnTJwxsKM
309,factor here though is that it just so,613.79,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
310,happens that Samsung's high-end is 50%,615.68,4.65,MHWnTJwxsKM
311,more expensive than one pluses high-end,618.17,4.26,MHWnTJwxsKM
312,you are getting a more impressive spec,620.33,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
313,sheet with the Samsung you're getting,622.43,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
314,those extreme numbers that you're paying,624.17,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
315,for things like a 100 an 8 megapixel,625.94,4.44,MHWnTJwxsKM
316,camera versus 48 a five thousand,627.95,5.58,MHWnTJwxsKM
317,milliamp hour battery versus 4510 on one,630.38,6.12,MHWnTJwxsKM
318,plus 16 gigs of ram versus 12 and so on,633.53,4.95,MHWnTJwxsKM
319,but from my time with it these extreme,636.5,4.2,MHWnTJwxsKM
320,specifications don't really translate to,638.48,4.83,MHWnTJwxsKM
321,an extreme experience in its defense,640.7,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
322,I think the s20 ultra gets more flack,643.31,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
323,than it deserves this is a beastly phone,645.32,4.23,MHWnTJwxsKM
324,providing you get the Snapdragon version,647.69,3.36,MHWnTJwxsKM
325,but I really think the only people it,649.55,3.33,MHWnTJwxsKM
326,applies to are people who are really,651.05,3.81,MHWnTJwxsKM
327,interested in the galaxy s xx but who,652.88,3.899,MHWnTJwxsKM
328,are willing to pay more the ultra looks,654.86,3.87,MHWnTJwxsKM
329,really impressive next to Samsung's own,656.779,3.451,MHWnTJwxsKM
330,lineup where you can see side-by-side,658.73,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
331,each extra thing you're getting for your,660.23,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
332,money that extra Ram that bigger back,662.36,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
333,three that further zoom on your camera,664.37,3.36,MHWnTJwxsKM
334,it seems worth it but when you kind of,666.11,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
335,take the Galaxy S 20 ultra out of that,667.73,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
336,context when you pitch it against,669.68,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
337,aggressively price competition like this,671.48,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
338,I think the value proposition of the,673.25,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
339,phone crumbles and so I think it's,675.17,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
340,pretty clear between the two one plus,677.18,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
341,wins you don't forget to check out the,679.31,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
342,video I made on the oneplus 8 vs iPhone,680.96,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
343,11 I think it's really interesting and,683.06,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
344,without being said my name is Aaron this,684.8,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
345,is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you,686.69,4.85,MHWnTJwxsKM

58,We've got minimal bezels with a punch-out.,138.23,3.41,5mL_LAuuq6A
59,"Now, I would say that the S20 Ultra",141.64,1.89,5mL_LAuuq6A
60,"does have a slightly
smaller bezel on the top,",143.53,3.27,5mL_LAuuq6A
61,"but they're very, very similar.",146.8,1.73,5mL_LAuuq6A
62,Both displays also curve from the sides.,148.53,2.31,5mL_LAuuq6A
63,"However, the OnePlus 8
Pro is a bit more curved",150.84,3.09,5mL_LAuuq6A

to the S20 Ultra.",153.93,3.69,5mL_LAuuq6A

has a 6.78 inch display.",157.62,3.96,5mL_LAuuq6A
66,"The S20 Ultra has a slightly
larger 6.9 inch display.",161.58,4.18,5mL_LAuuq6A
67,Both of these are using AMOLED technology.,165.76,2.73,5mL_LAuuq6A
68,Both have up to a Quad HD+ resolution,168.49,2.85,5mL_LAuuq6A
69,"and both also supports
a 120 Hertz refresh rate",171.34,4.3,5mL_LAuuq6A
70,with 240 Hertz of touch input.,175.64,3.24,5mL_LAuuq6A
71,"But, there is a little bit of a catch.",178.88,1.98,5mL_LAuuq6A
72,On the S20 Ultra you can only have,180.86,2.57,5mL_LAuuq6A
73,the 120 Hertz refresh rate.,183.43,2.29,5mL_LAuuq6A
74,"If you're at Full HD you
cannot have this at Quad HD.",185.72,3.84,5mL_LAuuq6A
75,"Now, this seems to be
to save on battery life,",189.56,3.58,5mL_LAuuq6A
76,"but on the OnePlus 8 Pro
you do have that option.",193.14,3.65,5mL_LAuuq6A
77,"So, if you do want to go all out",196.79,1.52,5mL_LAuuq6A
78,"and absolutely kill your battery,",198.31,2.12,5mL_LAuuq6A
79,you can do that.,200.43,0.833,5mL_LAuuq6A
80,"And I like that this option is here,",201.263,1.807,5mL_LAuuq6A
81,"because maybe you do want
that very high resolution,",203.07,2.93,5mL_LAuuq6A
82,"as well as that high refresh rate,",206.0,2.8,5mL_LAuuq6A
83,"and this is an advantage
that the OnePlus 8 Pro has.",208.8,3.6,5mL_LAuuq6A
84,"The OnePlus 8 Pro also
has MEMC technology,",212.4,3.62,5mL_LAuuq6A
85,"so that's motion estimation
and motion compensation.",216.02,4.02,5mL_LAuuq6A
86,This is essentially going to take content,220.04,1.62,5mL_LAuuq6A
87,"that's at a standard prime
rate, say 25, 30 frames a second",221.66,3.52,5mL_LAuuq6A
88,"and make it seem as though
it's at a higher frame rate",225.18,3.39,5mL_LAuuq6A
89,"by applying motion smoothness
and things like that.",228.57,3.3,5mL_LAuuq6A
90,"This is something that
you may, or may not like.",231.87,2.65,5mL_LAuuq6A

93,as well as YouTube.,239.35,1.47,5mL_LAuuq6A
94,"Now, generally speaking
I don't think you can",240.82,1.95,5mL_LAuuq6A
95,"go wrong with either of these displays,",242.77,1.9,5mL_LAuuq6A
96,"they are some of the
best displays out there.",244.67,2.65,5mL_LAuuq6A
97,"The OnePlus 8 Pro you are
getting that advantage",247.32,2.7,5mL_LAuuq6A
98,of Quad HD+ with a 120 Hertz.,250.02,3.0,5mL_LAuuq6A
99,On the S20 Ultra you're getting,253.02,1.8,5mL_LAuuq6A
100,"a center punch-out, which
I do personally prefer",254.82,2.48,5mL_LAuuq6A
101,a little bit to the side punch-out,257.3,2.81,5mL_LAuuq6A
102,here on the OnePlus 8 Pro.,260.11,2.2,5mL_LAuuq6A
103,"And the display is also
a little bit flatter,",262.31,2.78,5mL_LAuuq6A
104,"compared to the very curved
display of the OnePlus 8 Pro.",265.09,3.59,5mL_LAuuq6A
105,"Now, another thing is that the S20 Ultra",268.68,2.59,5mL_LAuuq6A
106,"does have an Always-On Display,",271.27,1.87,5mL_LAuuq6A
107,"which is something that I
personally find really useful.",273.14,2.48,5mL_LAuuq6A
108,You can just see things at a glance.,275.62,2.1,5mL_LAuuq6A
109,"The OnePlus 8 Pro unfortunately
still does not have this.",277.72,3.13,5mL_LAuuq6A
110,"I'm sure it can come
with a software update,",280.85,2.31,5mL_LAuuq6A
111,but currently and its state right now,283.16,3.24,5mL_LAuuq6A
112,it is not there unfortunately.,286.4,2.13,5mL_LAuuq6A
113,"Now, both devices do have an
in-display fingerprint scanner,",288.53,2.99,5mL_LAuuq6A
114,"which is very, very, fast.",291.52,1.44,5mL_LAuuq6A
115,"However, the technology
is quite different.",292.96,2.2,5mL_LAuuq6A
116,The OnePlus 8 Pro has an optical,295.16,2.22,5mL_LAuuq6A
117,in-display fingerprint scanner.,297.38,1.49,5mL_LAuuq6A
118,The S20 Ultra has an ultrasonic,298.87,2.12,5mL_LAuuq6A
119,in-display fingerprint scanner.,300.99,1.59,5mL_LAuuq6A
120,"So, the technology is
superior on the S20 Ultra.",302.58,3.46,5mL_LAuuq6A
121,"It is actually measuring
the ridges in your fingers.",306.04,3.63,5mL_LAuuq6A
122,"However, the OnePlus 8 Pro can be",309.67,2.24,5mL_LAuuq6A
123,a little bit faster I have found.,311.91,1.99,5mL_LAuuq6A
124,"Now, one thing that I don't
like on the OnePlus 8 Pro",313.9,2.59,5mL_LAuuq6A
125,"is that you do have to wake
the device before you can use",316.49,3.47,5mL_LAuuq6A
126,the fingerprint scanner.,319.96,1.11,5mL_LAuuq6A
127,"So, there is an extra step involved.",321.07,1.93,5mL_LAuuq6A
128,"You have to either tap to
wake it, then press it,",323.0,2.92,5mL_LAuuq6A
129,or lift the device to wake it.,325.92,2.22,5mL_LAuuq6A
130,Whereas on the S20 Ultra it is always on,328.14,2.76,5mL_LAuuq6A
131,and you can just tap in this area,330.9,2.28,5mL_LAuuq6A
132,"whenever and it's going
to unlock your device.",333.18,2.07,5mL_LAuuq6A
133,"So, I know a lot of people
do praise OnePlus devices",335.25,3.07,5mL_LAuuq6A
134,"for the fingerprint
scanner and how fast it is,",338.32,2.77,5mL_LAuuq6A
135,"but for me that extra step
actually makes it slower.",341.09,3.03,5mL_LAuuq6A
136,"So I do personally prefer
the ultrasonic in-display",344.12,3.11,5mL_LAuuq6A
137,fingerprint scanner on the S20 Ultra.,347.23,2.12,5mL_LAuuq6A
138,"Now, let's talk about the cameras.",349.35,1.08,5mL_LAuuq6A
139,We'll start with the front-facing cameras.,350.43,1.57,5mL_LAuuq6A
140,"You can see here that we
do have the punch-outs.",352.0,2.89,5mL_LAuuq6A
141,"The S20 Ultra does have a high resolution,",354.89,2.94,5mL_LAuuq6A
142,as well as a wider aperture.,357.83,1.618,5mL_LAuuq6A
143,And you can see some samples here.,359.448,1.742,5mL_LAuuq6A
144,"I think both of them do a
pretty good job overall.",361.19,2.93,5mL_LAuuq6A
145,I do find that the OnePlus 8 Pro,364.12,2.12,5mL_LAuuq6A
146,does still overexpose for selfies.,366.24,2.57,5mL_LAuuq6A
147,This is something that I've noticed,368.81,1.72,5mL_LAuuq6A
148,on previous OnePlus devices as well.,370.53,2.17,5mL_LAuuq6A
149,"It does make you look a little bit fairer,",372.7,1.82,5mL_LAuuq6A
150,compared to how you actually are.,374.52,2.19,5mL_LAuuq6A
151,"The S20 Ultra, although it's
not my favorite selfie camera",376.71,3.63,5mL_LAuuq6A
152,and it can still lighten,380.34,1.45,5mL_LAuuq6A
153,your skin a little bit.,381.79,1.31,5mL_LAuuq6A
154,I would still prefer it overall,383.1,2.47,5mL_LAuuq6A
155,to the OnePlus 8 Pro.,385.57,1.96,5mL_LAuuq6A
156,"And also for video,",387.53,1.01,5mL_LAuuq6A
157,because the OnePlus 8 Pro can only film,388.54,3.34,5mL_LAuuq6A
158,at 180p from the front-facing camera,391.88,2.26,5mL_LAuuq6A
159,at 30 frames a second.,394.14,1.45,5mL_LAuuq6A
160,"The S20 Ultra can film
at up to 4K, 60 frames",395.59,4.02,5mL_LAuuq6A
161,a second from the front-facing camera.,399.61,1.69,5mL_LAuuq6A
162,"So, for those reasons the
edge does go to the S20 Ultra",401.3,3.28,5mL_LAuuq6A
163,"for the front-facing camera,",404.58,1.85,5mL_LAuuq6A
164,but things are quite interesting,406.43,1.65,5mL_LAuuq6A
165,when we look at the rear-facing cameras.,408.08,2.07,5mL_LAuuq6A
166,"So, we do have a Quad camera setup",410.15,2.33,5mL_LAuuq6A
167,on both of these.,412.48,1.57,5mL_LAuuq6A
168,The three main cameras are similar,414.05,2.23,5mL_LAuuq6A
169,"in the sense that we've
got an ultra-wide camera,",416.28,2.37,5mL_LAuuq6A
170,we've got a primary camera,418.65,1.82,5mL_LAuuq6A
171,"and then we've got a telephoto camera,",420.47,2.22,5mL_LAuuq6A
172,which is going to give optical zoom.,422.69,1.83,5mL_LAuuq6A
173,The fourth camera is different.,424.52,1.44,5mL_LAuuq6A
174,"The S20 Ultra has a Time of Flight sensor,",425.96,2.85,5mL_LAuuq6A
175,"which is going to help
with depth information.",428.81,2.24,5mL_LAuuq6A
176,"The OnePlus 8 Pro has
a color filer camera,",431.05,3.27,5mL_LAuuq6A
177,"which I'm still a little
bit confused about.",434.32,1.62,5mL_LAuuq6A
178,"I'm not sure what the
exact use of this is,",435.94,2.7,5mL_LAuuq6A
179,"because as far as I can
see a lot of the filters",438.64,2.81,5mL_LAuuq6A
180,"that you get on there
you can actually apply",441.45,2.57,5mL_LAuuq6A
181,"in a post anyway, but
nevertheless it's there.",444.02,4.21,5mL_LAuuq6A
182,"Now, you can see a few samples",448.23,1.55,5mL_LAuuq6A
183,"here, the primary cameras
I'd say are very good",449.78,2.78,5mL_LAuuq6A
184,on both for most situations.,452.56,2.7,5mL_LAuuq6A
185,"They do have good dynamic
range overall and good colors.",455.26,3.69,5mL_LAuuq6A
186,"For the ultra-wide cameras
I think both do a good job.",458.95,3.27,5mL_LAuuq6A
187,"The S20 Ultra is slightly wider,",462.22,2.26,5mL_LAuuq6A
188,which I do prefer.,464.48,1.27,5mL_LAuuq6A
189,And for the telephoto cameras,465.75,1.94,5mL_LAuuq6A
190,"the S20 Ultra does have
much more optical zoom.",467.69,3.79,5mL_LAuuq6A
191,"So you can get in much
closer to you subjects",471.48,2.92,5mL_LAuuq6A
192,and this is a lot more noticeable,474.4,1.47,5mL_LAuuq6A
193,"when you go to the likes
of 10 times up to 30 times.",475.87,3.77,5mL_LAuuq6A
194,"Now, I know it does seem 100X here",479.64,2.13,5mL_LAuuq6A
195,"on the S20 Ultra, but you guys probably",481.77,1.85,5mL_LAuuq6A
196,already know how I feel about this.,483.62,2.3,5mL_LAuuq6A
197,"It's not really practical,",485.92,1.31,5mL_LAuuq6A
198,it's not really usable.,487.23,1.5,5mL_LAuuq6A
199,"I'm not sure why Samsung
have plastered 100X on here",488.73,4.44,5mL_LAuuq6A
200,when it is at this level.,493.17,2.1,5mL_LAuuq6A
201,"It's fine to have and
you don't need to use it,",495.27,2.08,5mL_LAuuq6A
202,"but Samsung don't plaster
it on the freaking device.",497.35,3.13,5mL_LAuuq6A
203,"Now, for low light it
was quite interesting,",500.48,2.01,5mL_LAuuq6A
204,"because in certain situations
I did prefer the S20 Ultra,",502.49,3.04,5mL_LAuuq6A
205,"in certain situations I
preferred the OnePlus 8 Pro.",505.53,3.05,5mL_LAuuq6A
206,Here you can see an outdoor shot.,508.58,2.158,5mL_LAuuq6A
207,"The S20 Ultra for me is a lot better,",510.738,2.642,5mL_LAuuq6A
208,there's a lot of processing happening,513.38,1.5,5mL_LAuuq6A
209,on the OnePlus 8 Pro's shot.,514.88,2.43,5mL_LAuuq6A
210,"But, on this indoor shot I
did prefer the OnePlus 8 Pro",517.31,4.11,5mL_LAuuq6A
211,"which did better maintain
the colors and the detail",521.42,2.61,5mL_LAuuq6A
212,compared to the S20 Ultra.,524.03,2.15,5mL_LAuuq6A
213,The OnePlus 8 Pro also has a macro mode,526.18,2.79,5mL_LAuuq6A
214,which lets you get in super up-close,528.97,2.56,5mL_LAuuq6A
215,using the ultra-wide camera.,531.53,2.0,5mL_LAuuq6A
216,"This is something you don't
have on the S20 Ultra.",533.53,2.87,5mL_LAuuq6A
217,"Now, for video both did
seem to do a good job.",536.4,2.79,5mL_LAuuq6A
218,"One area where the OnePlus
8 Pro is definitely better",539.19,2.71,5mL_LAuuq6A
219,is in autofocus.,541.9,1.24,5mL_LAuuq6A
220,"This is something that the
Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra",543.14,2.66,5mL_LAuuq6A
221,"has struggle with, even
after numerous updates.",545.8,3.45,5mL_LAuuq6A

dual pixel autofocus,",549.25,2.84,5mL_LAuuq6A
223,"which Samsung has been known for,",552.09,1.37,5mL_LAuuq6A
224,for a long time and it can struggle,553.46,2.11,5mL_LAuuq6A
225,a lot of times with focus.,555.57,1.95,5mL_LAuuq6A
226,"The OnePlus 8 Pro is definitely
faster and better here.",557.52,3.467,5mL_LAuuq6A
227,And rear-facing cameras.,560.987,2.246,5mL_LAuuq6A
228,We can switch to ultra-wide on both.,566.9,4.71,5mL_LAuuq6A
229,And we can also zoom.,574.21,1.85,5mL_LAuuq6A
230,It's three times,576.06,0.96,5mL_LAuuq6A
231,on the OnePlus 8 Pro,580.98,1.43,5mL_LAuuq6A
232,and there's five times,582.41,3.4,5mL_LAuuq6A
233,on the S20 Ultra.,586.97,3.07,5mL_LAuuq6A
234,The S20 Ultra however does offer 8K video.,590.04,3.82,5mL_LAuuq6A
235,"Now, this is a great add.",593.86,1.61,5mL_LAuuq6A
236,It does crop in quite heavily,595.47,1.77,5mL_LAuuq6A
237,"and you do lose some
stabilization and things,",597.24,2.81,5mL_LAuuq6A

248,"Now, let's talk about the performance.",623.32,1.26,5mL_LAuuq6A
249,"So the OnePlus 8 Pro,
it is all about speed.",624.58,2.8,5mL_LAuuq6A
250,"It does come with the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 865 chip set,",627.38,3.49,5mL_LAuuq6A

have a choice about this.",669.4,2.04,5mL_LAuuq6A

available in a 256 byte option.",698.13,4.56,5mL_LAuuq6A
274,For RAM the S20 Ultra does come,702.69,1.68,5mL_LAuuq6A
275,with more RAM straight off the back.,704.37,1.84,5mL_LAuuq6A
276,"So, you've got 12
gigabytes of RAM as a base,",706.21,1.8,5mL_LAuuq6A
277,you've got up to 16 gigabytes.,708.01,1.72,5mL_LAuuq6A
278,"The OnePlus 8 Pro comes in either eight,",709.73,2.68,5mL_LAuuq6A
279,or 12 gigabytes of RAM.,712.41,1.78,5mL_LAuuq6A
280,"And now in speed and
performance generally speaking,",714.19,1.75,5mL_LAuuq6A
281,"both of these are going
to be really, really good.",715.94,2.06,5mL_LAuuq6A
282,The S20 Ultra does get one advantage,718.0,1.9,5mL_LAuuq6A
283,"and that is that it does
have a micro SD card slot,",719.9,2.9,5mL_LAuuq6A
284,"so you can expand the storage
here on the S20 Ultra.",722.8,3.44,5mL_LAuuq6A
285,"You cannot expand the
storage on the OnePlus 8 Pro.",726.24,3.4,5mL_LAuuq6A
286,The OnePlus 8 Pro also comes as default,729.64,2.4,5mL_LAuuq6A
287,"with dual SIM functionality,
so that's great.",732.04,3.11,5mL_LAuuq6A
288,"The S20 Ultra, again,
this is going to vary",735.15,1.92,5mL_LAuuq6A
289,depending on your region.,737.07,0.89,5mL_LAuuq6A
290,"Some regions do have
dual SIM, others do not.",737.96,2.93,5mL_LAuuq6A
291,"Now, let's talk about the software.",740.89,1.08,5mL_LAuuq6A
292,"So both devices do have
Android 10 out of the box,",741.97,3.18,5mL_LAuuq6A
293,and they come with their own skins.,745.15,1.99,5mL_LAuuq6A
294,"So, on the OnePlus 8
Pro we do have OxygenOS.",747.14,3.2,5mL_LAuuq6A
295,The S20 Ultra comes with OneUI.,750.34,1.96,5mL_LAuuq6A
296,"Now, realistically speaking these are some",752.3,1.96,5mL_LAuuq6A
297,of my favorite skins.,754.26,1.35,5mL_LAuuq6A
298,"They are my top two, they're
very clean, very functional",755.61,3.85,5mL_LAuuq6A
299,"and they also do add
features that you don't get",759.46,2.43,5mL_LAuuq6A
300,as defaults on stock Android.,761.89,2.09,5mL_LAuuq6A
301,"So, I'm very happy with both of these.",763.98,2.08,5mL_LAuuq6A
302,"A lot of it is going to come
down to your personal preference.",766.06,2.31,5mL_LAuuq6A
303,"One advantage that I have
to give to the OnePlus 8 Pro",768.37,3.47,5mL_LAuuq6A
304,"is that OnePlus is really,
really good with updates.",771.84,2.75,5mL_LAuuq6A
305,"They do generally provide
updates much faster",774.59,3.0,5mL_LAuuq6A
306,"than the likes of Samsung,
as well as many others.",777.59,3.16,5mL_LAuuq6A
307,"So, if updates are important to you then",780.75,2.3,5mL_LAuuq6A
308,"the OnePlus 8 Pro is going
to be a great option.",783.05,2.88,5mL_LAuuq6A
309,"Now, for speakers both devices
do have stereo speakers.",785.93,2.58,5mL_LAuuq6A
310,We've got one bottom-firing and then we've,788.51,1.51,5mL_LAuuq6A
311,got one in the earpiece.,790.02,1.53,5mL_LAuuq6A
312,"Both sound really, really good.",791.55,2.24,5mL_LAuuq6A
313,And now let's talk about the batteries.,793.79,1.86,5mL_LAuuq6A
314,"So the S20 Ultra does
have a larger battery,",795.65,3.62,5mL_LAuuq6A
315,and in my usage it's been really good.,799.27,2.64,5mL_LAuuq6A
316,"However, this is once again going
to come down to your region.",801.91,3.28,5mL_LAuuq6A
317,"The Exynos version is
not as power efficient,",805.19,2.43,5mL_LAuuq6A
318,"which means I'm getting
around 20% less battery life",807.62,3.59,5mL_LAuuq6A
319,"on my Exynos version, compared",811.21,2.33,5mL_LAuuq6A
320,to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865.,813.54,2.41,5mL_LAuuq6A
321,And I am generally getting over six hours,815.95,1.76,5mL_LAuuq6A
322,of screen-on time on a regular basis.,817.71,1.79,5mL_LAuuq6A
323,"So, I've been very, very
happy with the S20 Ultra.",819.5,3.03,5mL_LAuuq6A
324,"Now, bear in mind this is
Full HD+ at a 120 Hertz,",822.53,4.52,5mL_LAuuq6A
325,with the Qualcomm version.,827.05,1.65,5mL_LAuuq6A
326,"I've not have the OnePlus
8 Pro long enough as yet",828.7,2.94,5mL_LAuuq6A
327,"to give you a proper
conclusion of battery life.",831.64,2.33,5mL_LAuuq6A
328,"Generally speaking it has
been pretty good for me",833.97,2.96,5mL_LAuuq6A
329,and does get me through the day.,836.93,1.94,5mL_LAuuq6A
330,"For charging, both of these
do support very fast charging",838.87,2.73,5mL_LAuuq6A
331,"out of the box, however you do
get a slightly faster charger",841.6,3.53,5mL_LAuuq6A
332,"with the OnePlus 8 Pro,
compared to the S20 Ultra.",845.13,3.79,5mL_LAuuq6A
333,"However, you can buy a 45
Watt charger separately,",848.92,3.58,5mL_LAuuq6A
334,"which is going to charge up
the S20 Ultra very, very fast.",852.5,3.45,5mL_LAuuq6A
335,And the OnePlus 8 Pro for the first time,855.95,2.85,5mL_LAuuq6A
336,"on a OnePlus device does
have wireless charging.",858.8,3.45,5mL_LAuuq6A
337,"This is something that
I've been asking for,",862.25,1.59,5mL_LAuuq6A
338,"for a very, very long time.",863.84,1.92,5mL_LAuuq6A
339,"And not only that, it's
also very, very fast",865.76,2.82,5mL_LAuuq6A
340,compared to the S20 Ultra.,868.58,2.13,5mL_LAuuq6A
341,"The S20 Ultra is around 15
Watts and the OnePlus 8 Pro",870.71,4.13,5mL_LAuuq6A
342,is going towards 30 Watts.,874.84,1.84,5mL_LAuuq6A
343,"So, you're getting from one
to 50% in just 30 minutes.",876.68,4.28,5mL_LAuuq6A
344,"This is wireless charging,
so it's something",880.96,2.73,5mL_LAuuq6A
345,"that I'm very, very happy to
see here on the OnePlus 8 Pro.",883.69,3.64,5mL_LAuuq6A
346,"And both devices do support
reverse wireless charging.",887.33,2.85,5mL_LAuuq6A
347,"So, this is where you can use the devices",890.18,1.88,5mL_LAuuq6A
348,"to charge, maybe some accessories
or something wirelessly.",892.06,3.96,5mL_LAuuq6A
349,"Now, the S20 Ultra here
does get the advantage,",896.02,2.64,5mL_LAuuq6A
350,"because it does have faster
reverse wireless charging,",898.66,3.31,5mL_LAuuq6A
351,compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro.,901.97,2.63,5mL_LAuuq6A
352,"The OnePlus 8 Pro also has a new feature,",904.6,2.66,5mL_LAuuq6A
353,which OnePlus have introduced,907.26,1.42,5mL_LAuuq6A
354,"and that is smart charging optimization,",908.68,2.78,5mL_LAuuq6A
355,which is supposed to give your battery,911.46,2.81,5mL_LAuuq6A
356,a longer lifespan overtime.,914.27,2.89,5mL_LAuuq6A
357,And what this essentially does is,917.16,1.82,5mL_LAuuq6A
358,"it delays your charging
based on you usage pattern.",918.98,2.99,5mL_LAuuq6A
359,"So, say for instance you wake
up at 8:00 a.m. every day,",921.97,2.96,5mL_LAuuq6A
360,then it's not going to charge your device,924.93,2.11,5mL_LAuuq6A
361,to really 100% until you wake up.,927.04,3.08,5mL_LAuuq6A
362,and this way it should help,930.12,1.3,5mL_LAuuq6A
363,your battery health in the long term.,931.42,3.07,5mL_LAuuq6A
364,"Now, let's talk about the price.",934.49,2.4,5mL_LAuuq6A
365,"The OnePlus 8 Pro has gone up in price,",936.89,2.94,5mL_LAuuq6A
366,"compared to the previous generation,",939.83,1.82,5mL_LAuuq6A
367,something we've been seeing,941.65,1.13,5mL_LAuuq6A
368,from OnePlus year and year again.,942.78,1.79,5mL_LAuuq6A
369,So it is starting at around $900.,944.57,3.2,5mL_LAuuq6A
370,"The S20 Ultra however
does start much higher",947.77,3.33,5mL_LAuuq6A
371,"at around $1400, or around
1200 pounds here in the UK.",951.1,4.85,5mL_LAuuq6A
372,"So you are going to be
paying quite a bit more",955.95,2.14,5mL_LAuuq6A
373,"for the S20 Ultra compared
to the OnePlus 8 Pro.",958.09,4.22,5mL_LAuuq6A
374,"And the OnePlus 8 Pro, let's be real,",962.31,2.53,5mL_LAuuq6A
375,is the better overall deal here.,964.84,2.25,5mL_LAuuq6A
376,"You are getting a lot of
features for that price.",967.09,3.46,5mL_LAuuq6A
377,The S20 Ultra is a really good device,970.55,2.5,5mL_LAuuq6A
378,and it is offering some unique features,973.05,2.16,5mL_LAuuq6A
379,"such as that extensive zoom,",975.21,2.48,5mL_LAuuq6A
380,but is it worth that higher price tag?,977.69,2.91,5mL_LAuuq6A
381,What do you guys think?,980.6,1.06,5mL_LAuuq6A
382,"Definitely let me know

you would pick overall,",982.95,2.6,5mL_LAuuq6A

1,two highest end 2020 flag ships from 1,1.56,4.65,MHWnTJwxsKM
2,plus and samsung I've used both for a,3.78,4.35,MHWnTJwxsKM
3,fair bit of time now and today we're,6.21,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
4,going to declare a Android smartphone,8.13,4.11,MHWnTJwxsKM
5,king also alongside this video I've,9.96,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
6,launched another one comparing the,12.24,3.809,MHWnTJwxsKM
7,normal 1 plus 8 with Apple's iPhone 11,13.62,3.989,MHWnTJwxsKM
8,because that phone was basically built,16.049,3.39,MHWnTJwxsKM
9,to be an iPhone killer,17.609,3.481,MHWnTJwxsKM
10,so after you've seen this one then do,19.439,3.271,MHWnTJwxsKM
11,check that one out too in case you're,21.09,3.21,MHWnTJwxsKM
12,wondering this is the package oneplus,22.71,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
13,sent out to me it's the media kit which,24.3,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
14,has a few cool things inside for,26.67,4.019,MHWnTJwxsKM
15,starters a beefy reviewers guide I'm,28.47,4.95,MHWnTJwxsKM
16,talking a 60 page read over here and 2,30.689,4.921,MHWnTJwxsKM
17,official cases one is the sunstone,33.42,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
18,bumper which I mean it feels ok solid,35.61,4.289,MHWnTJwxsKM
19,all run protection with a textured,38.04,3.48,MHWnTJwxsKM
20,finish on both the outside and inside,39.899,4.561,MHWnTJwxsKM
21,but it is just a sheet of plastic the,41.52,5.1,MHWnTJwxsKM
22,second though is the carbon bumper which,44.46,4.439,MHWnTJwxsKM
23,i think is slightly nicer it's part TPU,46.62,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
24,and pot' Kevlar,48.899,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
25,it still feels slim and light but does,50.37,2.939,MHWnTJwxsKM
26,have a nice matte finish on the outside,52.079,4.531,MHWnTJwxsKM
27,texture on the inside and finally this,53.309,5.461,MHWnTJwxsKM
28,is the retail box the phone so if you,56.61,4.019,MHWnTJwxsKM
29,hopped into a store right now well this,58.77,3.809,MHWnTJwxsKM
30,is the box you'd get and I would go as,60.629,3.42,MHWnTJwxsKM
31,far as to say that the combination of,62.579,3.451,MHWnTJwxsKM
32,what it looks like and what you get in,64.049,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
33,here makes this one of my favorite boxes,66.03,3.87,MHWnTJwxsKM
34,and ever the phone is on top and below,67.979,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
35,that you get this elongated insert which,69.9,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
36,has a couple of cool things inside some,71.909,3.6,MHWnTJwxsKM
37,information cards a sheet of oneplus,73.83,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
38,stickers and the invitation letter which,75.509,3.811,MHWnTJwxsKM
39,has the similar typical attached on to,77.34,3.419,MHWnTJwxsKM
40,it this is just basically one plus,79.32,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
41,saying hi there yeah thanks for buying,80.759,4.381,MHWnTJwxsKM
42,me there's more though I'm a big fan of,83.07,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
43,this case they've added in there it's,85.14,4.409,MHWnTJwxsKM
44,not just some lazy generic TPU sheet,86.85,5.01,MHWnTJwxsKM
45,it's got the never settle slogan in Vic,89.549,4.351,MHWnTJwxsKM
46,text it's got a matte finish on the,91.86,4.41,MHWnTJwxsKM
47,rails texture on the inside and a little,93.9,5.219,MHWnTJwxsKM
48,designed by 1 plus text there's a USBC,96.27,5.309,MHWnTJwxsKM
49,cable for charging and a 30 watt warp,99.119,4.86,MHWnTJwxsKM
50,charger this is fast the eagle-eyed,101.579,3.961,MHWnTJwxsKM
51,among you might have noticed that,103.979,3.451,MHWnTJwxsKM
52,oneplus is actually branded since their,105.54,3.869,MHWnTJwxsKM
53,last phone everything is now in all caps,107.43,4.71,MHWnTJwxsKM
54,with a slightly bolder logo anyways,109.409,4.35,MHWnTJwxsKM
55,holding these two phones together you'll,112.14,3.39,MHWnTJwxsKM
56,notice something the oneplus 8 pro is a,113.759,3.811,MHWnTJwxsKM
57,big phone but Samsung is a slightly,115.53,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
58,bigger in every dimension you'll almost,117.57,4.049,MHWnTJwxsKM
59,miss it at a glance but because it's,119.82,3.839,MHWnTJwxsKM
60,bigger from all angles it's taller,121.619,4.471,MHWnTJwxsKM
61,thicker heavier wider and so when you,123.659,3.871,MHWnTJwxsKM
62,add all those together this feels like a,126.09,3.029,MHWnTJwxsKM
63,middleweight versus heavy weight,127.53,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
64,situation like no one ever wants to drop,129.119,3.631,MHWnTJwxsKM
65,their phone on their face when they're,131.37,2.43,MHWnTJwxsKM
66,scrolling embedded,132.75,2.94,MHWnTJwxsKM
67,right but I get the feeling that if you,133.8,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
68,did do that with this phone you'd be out,135.69,4.86,MHWnTJwxsKM
69,for a few days and as a result almost by,138.09,4.71,MHWnTJwxsKM
70,default oneplus is the more ergonomic,140.55,4.71,MHWnTJwxsKM
71,palm friendly offering but on top of,142.8,4.59,MHWnTJwxsKM
72,that it's smaller dimensions are,145.26,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
73,combined with a slightly curved back and,147.39,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
74,a matte finish if you go for the top-end,149.43,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
75,model this I'm phone off in the UK at,151.35,3.99,MHWnTJwxsKM
76,least the two color options you get are,153.81,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
77,glossy black and this greeny blue color,155.34,5.04,MHWnTJwxsKM
78,bordering on being a little plain for,158.43,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
79,still it's done well and some color is,160.38,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
80,still better than no color like the,162.81,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
81,Samsung which comes in either black or,164.55,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
82,this exciting gray color,166.32,3.6,MHWnTJwxsKM
83,oh yeah and neither phone has a,168.3,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
84,headphone jack but oneplus does have a,169.92,3.81,MHWnTJwxsKM
85,dedicated slider for switching between,171.87,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
86,ring vibrate and silent,173.73,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
87,the only real design negative for,176.01,4.41,MHWnTJwxsKM
88,oneplus is the enormous camera bump it,177.87,3.72,MHWnTJwxsKM
89,was pretty much my first observation,180.42,3.27,MHWnTJwxsKM
90,when I took the phone out the box but,181.59,4.41,MHWnTJwxsKM
91,let's not forget Samsung sticks out just,183.69,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
92,as much but it's wider too if you're,186.0,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
93,going to use a case neither of these is,188.01,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
94,a big deal because they'll even out the,189.63,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
95,back but if you're going there the,191.46,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
96,protrusions on either side are enough,193.59,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
97,that you can't really use these phones,195.39,3.99,MHWnTJwxsKM
98,sitting on a flat surface okay anyways,197.22,3.9,MHWnTJwxsKM
99,the traditional oneplus smartphone,199.38,3.9,MHWnTJwxsKM
100,strategy has always been to cut a few,201.12,4.05,MHWnTJwxsKM
101,corners to make a firm that is nearly as,203.28,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
102,good as the top level flagship ferns but,205.17,4.8,MHWnTJwxsKM
103,much cheaper that's changing this time,207.12,4.74,MHWnTJwxsKM
104,round the oneplus 8 pro is edging ever,209.97,4.019,MHWnTJwxsKM
105,closer to costing as much as a flagship,211.86,5.01,MHWnTJwxsKM
106,I'll come to this but now with little if,213.989,5.761,MHWnTJwxsKM
107,any compromise for example past oneplus,216.87,4.8,MHWnTJwxsKM
108,phones they skipped an IP rating they,219.75,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
109,skipped wireless charging but now you've,221.67,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
110,got both and in fact one plus wireless,223.32,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
111,charging has gone from being,225.42,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
112,non-existent to now actually a head of,226.5,4.68,MHWnTJwxsKM
113,Samsung's it can charge with 30 watts of,229.05,4.47,MHWnTJwxsKM
114,power versus 15 on the ultra and,231.18,5.4,MHWnTJwxsKM
115,displays Samsung really is the one to,233.52,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
116,beat when it comes to smartphone screens,236.58,4.11,MHWnTJwxsKM
117,but for my preferences at least I would,238.14,4.47,MHWnTJwxsKM
118,go as far as to say that oneplus has,240.69,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
119,actually just done that they're similar,242.61,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
120,screens both friends actually use a,244.35,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
121,display made by Samsung they both have,246.12,5.01,MHWnTJwxsKM
122,insanely high quad HD plus resolutions,248.67,5.58,MHWnTJwxsKM
123,AMOLED technology for deep contrast 120,251.13,4.919,MHWnTJwxsKM
124,Hertz refresh rates for liquid smooth,254.25,3.9,MHWnTJwxsKM
125,performance and built in technologies to,256.049,3.991,MHWnTJwxsKM
126,reduce the amount of blue light emitted,258.15,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
127,which is just better for your sleep,260.04,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
128,cycle a similar size to is six point,261.6,4.25,MHWnTJwxsKM
129,seven eight inches versus six point,264.0,4.82,MHWnTJwxsKM
130,9 inches but a few differences and the,265.85,5.22,MHWnTJwxsKM
131,key one for me actually being brightness,268.82,3.9,MHWnTJwxsKM
132,I always couldn't believe it the one,271.07,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
133,plus looks significantly brighter than,272.72,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
134,Samsung's I've tried indoor I've tried,274.64,3.81,MHWnTJwxsKM
135,out door the same result we're talking a,276.56,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
136,screen so bright that sometimes I would,278.45,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
137,find myself not bothering to use the,280.01,3.6,MHWnTJwxsKM
138,torch but instead of just turning my,281.9,3.36,MHWnTJwxsKM
139,phone around and using the display oh,283.61,3.39,MHWnTJwxsKM
140,yeah and one plus can keep running a,285.26,3.87,MHWnTJwxsKM
141,quad HD plus resolution whilst having,287.0,4.26,MHWnTJwxsKM
142,it's 120 Hertz refresh rate on with,289.13,4.02,MHWnTJwxsKM
143,Samsung it's a case of deciding do I,291.26,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
144,want an ultra sharp display or do I want,293.15,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
145,an ultra smooth display and on top of,295.22,4.59,MHWnTJwxsKM
146,that yes there is more want less claims,296.84,4.74,MHWnTJwxsKM
147,they further extend their lead with,299.81,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
148,something called M EMC technology it's a,301.58,3.99,MHWnTJwxsKM
149,piece of software that tries to combat,304.1,3.21,MHWnTJwxsKM
150,the fact that we've got displays here,305.57,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
151,that refresh 120 times per second and,307.31,5.31,MHWnTJwxsKM
152,yet most videos are filmed at 24 or 30,309.53,5.04,MHWnTJwxsKM
153,so when you're using certain apps like,312.62,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
154,YouTube on this version it can actually,314.57,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
155,insert extra frames to make the video,316.31,4.53,MHWnTJwxsKM
156,appear smoother but after a bit I turn,318.35,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
157,the feature off it causes extra battery,320.84,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
158,drain and to be honest while it does,322.67,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
159,look beautiful on videos that are,324.5,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
160,already filmed at say 60 frames per,326.18,3.48,MHWnTJwxsKM
161,second what is trying to upscale videos,327.95,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
162,that are filmed at like 24 or 30 the end,329.66,3.99,MHWnTJwxsKM
163,results framerate is kind of all over,332.09,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
164,the place it kind of judders both phones,333.65,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
165,have an almost identically sized hole,336.26,3.87,MHWnTJwxsKM
166,punch do you want it on the side or do,338.03,3.21,MHWnTJwxsKM
167,you want it in the middle it is,340.13,2.73,MHWnTJwxsKM
168,completely up to you,341.24,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
169,me personally I'm a corner hole kind of,342.86,4.98,MHWnTJwxsKM
170,guy you lose symmetry but it means that,345.56,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
171,when you watch videos the hole punch,347.84,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
172,kind of disappears generally when you're,349.25,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
173,watching something your eyes are kind of,351.29,3.54,MHWnTJwxsKM
174,focused on the center of your screen so,352.76,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
175,if you have a corner hole punch it's,354.83,3.54,MHWnTJwxsKM
176,kind of further into your peripheral,356.42,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
177,vision the last thing I did notice is,358.37,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
178,the extra curve you get on the 8 pro's,360.35,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
179,display which for the most part is just,362.69,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
180,a subjective thing but I will say that,364.64,3.72,MHWnTJwxsKM
181,it's just enough of a curve that in some,366.62,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
182,rare cases when I was holding the phone,368.36,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
183,with one hand my other fingers would be,370.37,3.9,MHWnTJwxsKM
184,triggering the edges and this doesn't,372.14,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
185,seem to happen on the Samsung and one,374.27,3.42,MHWnTJwxsKM
186,thing I've really got a hand to Samsung,375.8,3.48,MHWnTJwxsKM
187,is the fact that in the last few years,377.69,3.27,MHWnTJwxsKM
188,they've brought their phones up from,379.28,3.12,MHWnTJwxsKM
189,being some of the more bloated and,380.96,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
190,sluggish offerings to actually some of,382.4,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
191,the snappiest 1 plus used to have a very,384.14,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
192,clear speed and actually even battery,386.24,4.23,MHWnTJwxsKM
193,advantage but I think it's starting to,388.46,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
194,fade and let me be very clear this is,390.47,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
195,not a case of one-plus getting slower by,392.24,3.27,MHWnTJwxsKM
196,any stretch of the imagination,394.1,3.81,MHWnTJwxsKM
197,v8 Pro is blistering fast it's just a,395.51,3.899,MHWnTJwxsKM
198,case that actually Samsung has caught,397.91,3.689,MHWnTJwxsKM
199,and we're at a stage where I really,399.409,3.24,MHWnTJwxsKM
200,can't tell much of a difference between,401.599,2.79,MHWnTJwxsKM
201,them anymore both phones have those,402.649,4.02,MHWnTJwxsKM
202,ultra fluid 120 Hertz displays and,404.389,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
203,pretty much the best specs you can hope,406.669,4.441,MHWnTJwxsKM
204,for top-end chipsets a ton of RAM up to,408.349,5.52,MHWnTJwxsKM
205,12 gigs on oneplus and 16 on Samsung and,411.11,5.909,MHWnTJwxsKM
206,fast u FS 3.0 storage the only caveat,413.869,4.98,MHWnTJwxsKM
207,with the Samsung is and we've gone,417.019,3.24,MHWnTJwxsKM
208,through this is the fact that there's,418.849,2.46,MHWnTJwxsKM
209,two different versions of the phone,420.259,3.0,MHWnTJwxsKM
210,depending on which region you're in and,421.309,3.301,MHWnTJwxsKM
211,long story short if you get the,423.259,2.97,MHWnTJwxsKM
212,Snapdragon version in your region you,424.61,3.449,MHWnTJwxsKM
213,get to go this is a really fantastically,426.229,3.54,MHWnTJwxsKM
214,performing phone but if you get the,428.059,5.1,MHWnTJwxsKM
215,Exynos version and not so much but the,429.769,5.22,MHWnTJwxsKM
216,full detail is linked somewhere here so,433.159,3.3,MHWnTJwxsKM
217,you can check that up I guess the point,434.989,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
218,here is that no matter what region,436.459,2.97,MHWnTJwxsKM
219,you're in with the oneplus you'll get,438.169,3.33,MHWnTJwxsKM
220,the better Snapdragon chip even the,439.429,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
221,speakers on the oneplus a top level this,441.499,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
222,is another corner the company has,443.809,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
223,historically cut but not anymore you get,445.069,5.22,MHWnTJwxsKM
224,one on the front on bottom vocals and,447.739,5.16,MHWnTJwxsKM
225,instrumentals just sounded so crisp and,450.289,4.59,MHWnTJwxsKM
226,I would say the volume is comparable,452.899,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
227,between the two so at this stage it's,454.879,3.36,MHWnTJwxsKM
228,starting to seem a little bit like a,457.069,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
229,homerun for one plus it seems as if it,458.239,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
230,does pretty much everything the s20,460.999,3.21,MHWnTJwxsKM
231,ultra does but just at least as good or,462.379,4.5,MHWnTJwxsKM
232,better and it's far cheaper so does the,464.209,5.31,MHWnTJwxsKM
233,s20 ultra even have a place well the one,466.879,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
234,area where I can see oneplus two saved,469.519,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
235,some money versus Samsung is the camera,471.169,4.08,MHWnTJwxsKM
236,system and so while Samsung has a,473.659,4.081,MHWnTJwxsKM
237,massive 108 megapixel main sensor,475.249,5.13,MHWnTJwxsKM
238,oneplus has a smaller 48 megapixel one,477.74,4.289,MHWnTJwxsKM
239,it's a new sensor it's an improvement,480.379,3.45,MHWnTJwxsKM
240,from last gen but not as good as,482.029,3.0,MHWnTJwxsKM
241,Samsung's something has a,483.829,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
242,high-resolution telephoto camera that,485.029,4.26,MHWnTJwxsKM
243,you do 10 times hybrid zoom what Plus,487.009,4.59,MHWnTJwxsKM
244,can do three times hybrid zoom and they,489.289,4.08,MHWnTJwxsKM
245,both have pretty comparable ultra white,491.599,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
246,cameras but this is where it gets weird,493.369,4.2,MHWnTJwxsKM
247,these are both quad camera systems,495.289,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
248,Samsung's forth is a time-of-flight,497.569,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
249,camera to detect depth but oneplus is,499.429,4.17,MHWnTJwxsKM
250,fourth is something called a color,502.189,4.111,MHWnTJwxsKM
251,filter camera or in other words a camera,503.599,4.02,MHWnTJwxsKM
252,that can view the world in a slightly,506.3,3.0,MHWnTJwxsKM
253,different way and I'll give it this it,507.619,3.72,MHWnTJwxsKM
254,has been fun walking around and just,509.3,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
255,seeing how different normal day-to-day,511.339,4.411,MHWnTJwxsKM
256,objects look but honestly I have really,512.99,4.319,MHWnTJwxsKM
257,tried to give this thing a chance and I,515.75,3.18,MHWnTJwxsKM
258,just don't get it it doesn't make any,517.309,4.02,MHWnTJwxsKM
259,sense to me the camera is low resolution,518.93,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
260,and it doesn't let nearly as much light,521.329,3.211,MHWnTJwxsKM
261,in as your main camera in a best-case,522.86,3.539,MHWnTJwxsKM
262,scenario your outputs gonna look like a,524.54,4.049,MHWnTJwxsKM
263,really old film and in worst case it'll,526.399,3.601,MHWnTJwxsKM
264,just look like something's gone wrong,528.589,2.971,MHWnTJwxsKM
265,maybe someone will,530.0,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
266,really cool views for it but considering,531.56,3.719,MHWnTJwxsKM
267,that in my briefing of the phone the,533.66,3.15,MHWnTJwxsKM
268,company barely touched on it and,535.279,3.391,MHWnTJwxsKM
269,considering that the setting for using,536.81,3.33,MHWnTJwxsKM
270,this camera is hidden away in the,538.67,2.28,MHWnTJwxsKM
271,filters menu,540.14,2.67,MHWnTJwxsKM
272,it suggests that oneplus isn't that,540.95,3.03,MHWnTJwxsKM
273,confident in it either,542.81,2.969,MHWnTJwxsKM
274,that said I spent most of my time with,543.98,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
275,oneplus camera actually just being taken,545.779,3.871,MHWnTJwxsKM
276,aback at how much they've improved the,547.76,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
277,rest of it it may be cheaper hardware,549.65,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
278,than what's on Samsung's but in almost,551.45,4.32,MHWnTJwxsKM
279,every situation the output is at least,553.43,4.47,MHWnTJwxsKM
280,as good Paswan plus phones had some,555.77,4.56,MHWnTJwxsKM
281,potentially wonky color processing none,557.9,4.02,MHWnTJwxsKM
282,of that here photos look true to life,560.33,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
283,and crispy with nice depth of field,561.92,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
284,thanks to a pretty large sensor and,564.11,4.29,MHWnTJwxsKM
285,video the video colors and the dynamic,565.88,4.98,MHWnTJwxsKM
286,range are stunning and lifelike it feels,568.4,3.96,MHWnTJwxsKM
287,like oneplus has gone right back to the,570.86,3.419,MHWnTJwxsKM
288,drawing board and built a completely new,572.36,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
289,color processing algorithm that just,574.279,2.581,MHWnTJwxsKM
290,works,576.02,3.33,MHWnTJwxsKM
291,monie current gripe is that while yes,576.86,4.77,MHWnTJwxsKM
292,that dynamic range is gorgeous the,579.35,4.98,MHWnTJwxsKM
293,focusing is not or at least it isn't yet,581.63,4.68,MHWnTJwxsKM
294,and funnily enough it just so happens,584.33,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
295,that this is also an issue for Samsung,586.31,3.66,MHWnTJwxsKM
296,but detail camera comparison coming very,588.02,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
297,soon so if you could subscribe to that,589.97,4.2,MHWnTJwxsKM
298,that would be amazing a few final things,591.8,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
299,to note both have in display fingerprint,594.17,4.68,MHWnTJwxsKM
300,scanners and dual SIM functionality but,596.42,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
301,with the Samsung you can actually use,598.85,3.03,MHWnTJwxsKM
302,one of those SIM card slots to double as,600.11,4.44,MHWnTJwxsKM
303,extra expandable storage I also slightly,601.88,4.47,MHWnTJwxsKM
304,prefer the haptic engine on the ultra,604.55,4.05,MHWnTJwxsKM
305,but you get good general vibration,606.35,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
306,feedback on both and in terms of,608.6,3.09,MHWnTJwxsKM
307,charging speeds you won't have a problem,610.1,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
308,whichever way you turn here the crucial,611.69,3.99,MHWnTJwxsKM
309,factor here though is that it just so,613.79,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
310,happens that Samsung's high-end is 50%,615.68,4.65,MHWnTJwxsKM
311,more expensive than one pluses high-end,618.17,4.26,MHWnTJwxsKM
312,you are getting a more impressive spec,620.33,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
313,sheet with the Samsung you're getting,622.43,3.51,MHWnTJwxsKM
314,those extreme numbers that you're paying,624.17,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
315,for things like a 100 an 8 megapixel,625.94,4.44,MHWnTJwxsKM
316,camera versus 48 a five thousand,627.95,5.58,MHWnTJwxsKM
317,milliamp hour battery versus 4510 on one,630.38,6.12,MHWnTJwxsKM
318,plus 16 gigs of ram versus 12 and so on,633.53,4.95,MHWnTJwxsKM
319,but from my time with it these extreme,636.5,4.2,MHWnTJwxsKM
320,specifications don't really translate to,638.48,4.83,MHWnTJwxsKM
321,an extreme experience in its defense,640.7,4.62,MHWnTJwxsKM
322,I think the s20 ultra gets more flack,643.31,4.38,MHWnTJwxsKM
323,than it deserves this is a beastly phone,645.32,4.23,MHWnTJwxsKM
324,providing you get the Snapdragon version,647.69,3.36,MHWnTJwxsKM
325,but I really think the only people it,649.55,3.33,MHWnTJwxsKM
326,applies to are people who are really,651.05,3.81,MHWnTJwxsKM
327,interested in the galaxy s xx but who,652.88,3.899,MHWnTJwxsKM
328,are willing to pay more the ultra looks,654.86,3.87,MHWnTJwxsKM
329,really impressive next to Samsung's own,656.779,3.451,MHWnTJwxsKM
330,lineup where you can see side-by-side,658.73,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
331,each extra thing you're getting for your,660.23,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
332,money that extra Ram that bigger back,662.36,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
333,three that further zoom on your camera,664.37,3.36,MHWnTJwxsKM
334,it seems worth it but when you kind of,666.11,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
335,take the Galaxy S 20 ultra out of that,667.73,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
336,context when you pitch it against,669.68,3.57,MHWnTJwxsKM
337,aggressively price competition like this,671.48,3.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
338,I think the value proposition of the,673.25,3.93,MHWnTJwxsKM
339,phone crumbles and so I think it's,675.17,4.14,MHWnTJwxsKM
340,pretty clear between the two one plus,677.18,3.78,MHWnTJwxsKM
341,wins you don't forget to check out the,679.31,3.75,MHWnTJwxsKM
342,video I made on the oneplus 8 vs iPhone,680.96,3.84,MHWnTJwxsKM
343,11 I think it's really interesting and,683.06,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
344,without being said my name is Aaron this,684.8,3.63,MHWnTJwxsKM
345,is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you,686.69,4.85,MHWnTJwxsKM
346,in the next one,688.43,3.11,MHWnTJwxsKM
347,[Music],691.64,16.69,MHWnTJwxsKM
0,okay this phone the 1+8 was basically,0.03,4.32,QlGqZCFfZOs
1,built with the purpose of beating the,2.25,4.259,QlGqZCFfZOs
2,iphone 11 everything from the cameras to,4.35,4.56,QlGqZCFfZOs
3,the pricing to the color choice makes it,6.509,3.781,QlGqZCFfZOs
4,pretty clear what oneplus have their,8.91,3.99,QlGqZCFfZOs
5,sights set on so let's find out if it,10.29,4.019,QlGqZCFfZOs
6,does that I've just launched another,12.9,3.09,QlGqZCFfZOs
7,video alongside this one which is the,14.309,3.751,QlGqZCFfZOs
8,highest end one plus eight pro versus,15.99,3.81,QlGqZCFfZOs
9,the best from Samsung so after this,18.06,3.51,QlGqZCFfZOs
10,video do check that one out too,19.8,3.42,QlGqZCFfZOs
11,also that custom mr. who's the boss,21.57,3.51,QlGqZCFfZOs
12,poster you can see behind me that's from,23.22,3.78,QlGqZCFfZOs
13,displayed to sponsored this video but,25.08,3.72,QlGqZCFfZOs
14,more on that later in terms of the media,27.0,3.39,QlGqZCFfZOs
15,kit that I received with this won't,28.8,3.569,QlGqZCFfZOs
16,recede it's more or less the same,30.39,3.96,QlGqZCFfZOs
17,unboxing experience as for the oneplus 8,32.369,3.6,QlGqZCFfZOs
18,pro which I covered in the other video,34.35,3.09,QlGqZCFfZOs
19,if you want to have a look but I will,35.969,3.391,QlGqZCFfZOs
20,just reiterate this I love the retail,37.44,3.9,QlGqZCFfZOs
21,packaging on these new oneplus phones if,39.36,3.629,QlGqZCFfZOs
22,oneplus are going to raise the prices of,41.34,3.48,QlGqZCFfZOs
23,their phones from mid-range to almost,42.989,3.451,QlGqZCFfZOs
24,high-end it's at least good to see that,44.82,3.719,QlGqZCFfZOs
25,they're presented accordingly the one,46.44,3.63,QlGqZCFfZOs
26,plus eight is pretty much the most,48.539,3.18,QlGqZCFfZOs
27,comfortable phone I've ever held the,50.07,3.54,QlGqZCFfZOs
28,phone has the same curved back and soft,51.719,3.301,QlGqZCFfZOs
29,touch matte finish as its pro,53.61,3.39,QlGqZCFfZOs
30,counterpart but it's slimmer it has a,55.02,3.66,QlGqZCFfZOs
31,smaller camera bump and is noticeably,57.0,3.78,QlGqZCFfZOs
32,lighter that my friends is quite the,58.68,3.449,QlGqZCFfZOs
33,combination it feels better than my,60.78,3.09,QlGqZCFfZOs
34,Samsung to holds better than the Huawei,62.129,3.481,QlGqZCFfZOs
35,it feels sure-enough better than the,63.87,4.02,QlGqZCFfZOs
36,iPhone 11 at that said the iPhone 11 is,65.61,3.78,QlGqZCFfZOs
37,hardly a bad feeling phone,67.89,3.0,QlGqZCFfZOs
38,I like the matte rails all the way,69.39,3.15,QlGqZCFfZOs
39,around the sides and it's palm friendly,70.89,4.11,QlGqZCFfZOs
40,size it's almost completely usable with,72.54,4.469,QlGqZCFfZOs
41,one hand which brings me to the only,75.0,3.659,QlGqZCFfZOs
42,thing I would say about the 1+8 design,77.009,3.391,QlGqZCFfZOs
43,it may be the slimmer and lighter phone,78.659,3.271,QlGqZCFfZOs
44,from the company but it's still not,80.4,3.539,QlGqZCFfZOs
45,small the display is tall enough that I,81.93,3.72,QlGqZCFfZOs
46,can still barely reach halfway up with,83.939,4.051,QlGqZCFfZOs
47,my thumb Bunce that display,85.65,3.81,QlGqZCFfZOs
48,holy moly the difference is just,87.99,4.26,QlGqZCFfZOs
49,astronomical by every possible metric I,89.46,4.229,QlGqZCFfZOs
50,could think of oneplus has the better,92.25,3.57,QlGqZCFfZOs
51,panel it's larger six point five five,93.689,4.171,QlGqZCFfZOs
52,inches versus six point one it uses a,95.82,3.9,QlGqZCFfZOs
53,more low tech for deeper contrast than,97.86,3.57,QlGqZCFfZOs
54,Apple's LCD and it's much higher,99.72,3.3,QlGqZCFfZOs
55,resolution you're looking at a full HD,101.43,3.99,QlGqZCFfZOs
56,plus panel which gives it about 80% more,103.02,4.47,QlGqZCFfZOs
57,pixels on its screen than the iPhone but,105.42,3.42,QlGqZCFfZOs
58,the gap gets bigger you've got one plus,107.49,3.33,QlGqZCFfZOs
59,is slim border and tiny hole punch,108.84,3.989,QlGqZCFfZOs
60,cutout which makes the iPhone look a,110.82,3.78,QlGqZCFfZOs
61,little bit like a toy in comparison and,112.829,3.451,QlGqZCFfZOs
62,it's brighter a little brighter if,114.6,3.21,QlGqZCFfZOs
63,you're looking head-on but because of,116.28,3.36,QlGqZCFfZOs
64,our LCD screen quality tends to,117.81,3.449,QlGqZCFfZOs
65,deteriorate from harsh viewing angles,119.64,3.329,QlGqZCFfZOs
66,oneplus is much brighter when you're,121.259,3.451,QlGqZCFfZOs
67,looking from anywhere but head on I,122.969,3.481,QlGqZCFfZOs
68,really can't emphasize this enough from,124.71,3.21,QlGqZCFfZOs
69,the front these phones quite literally,126.45,3.449,QlGqZCFfZOs
70,look five years apart this is the,127.92,5.82,QlGqZCFfZOs
71,high-end BMW 2 this phone's Fiat 500,129.899,6.121,QlGqZCFfZOs
72,and add to that the 1+8 has a fluid,133.74,4.47,QlGqZCFfZOs
73,ninety Hertz refresh rate versus ethyl,136.02,4.44,QlGqZCFfZOs
74,60 so it's more responsive - it's not,138.21,4.89,QlGqZCFfZOs
75,120 Hertz like the 1 + 8 Pro but I think,140.46,4.11,QlGqZCFfZOs
76,there is a bigger jump between 60 and 90,143.1,4.11,QlGqZCFfZOs
77,then there is between 90 and 120 oh yeah,144.57,4.35,QlGqZCFfZOs
78,and also in the screen of the 1 plus,147.21,3.51,QlGqZCFfZOs
79,you've got a fingerprint scanner with a,148.92,3.6,QlGqZCFfZOs
80,scanning area wide enough that you can,150.72,3.12,QlGqZCFfZOs
81,even miss it slightly and you'll still,152.52,2.97,QlGqZCFfZOs
82,get in well with the iPhone you'll be,153.84,3.9,QlGqZCFfZOs
83,using secure 3d face and locking which,155.49,3.9,QlGqZCFfZOs
84,to be fair is probably the most seamless,157.74,3.66,QlGqZCFfZOs
85,option between the two one plus does her,159.39,3.69,QlGqZCFfZOs
86,face scanning - but because it's just,161.4,3.78,QlGqZCFfZOs
87,using a front camera not a proper 3d,163.08,4.23,QlGqZCFfZOs
88,scanner it could potentially in theory,165.18,3.78,QlGqZCFfZOs
89,be breached by someone if they really,167.31,3.09,QlGqZCFfZOs
90,really want to get into your phone,168.96,3.93,QlGqZCFfZOs
91,anyways well the iPhones display doesn't,170.4,4.38,QlGqZCFfZOs
92,exactly fill you with confidence you,172.89,3.54,QlGqZCFfZOs
93,can't say this is not a seriously fast,174.78,3.93,QlGqZCFfZOs
94,phone in terms of performance it's every,176.43,3.72,QlGqZCFfZOs
95,bit as well SPECT as the thousand-dollar,178.71,3.9,QlGqZCFfZOs
96,iPhone 11 Pro it sings along no matter,180.15,4.14,QlGqZCFfZOs
97,the task whatever game whatever app,182.61,3.27,QlGqZCFfZOs
98,you'll struggle to make the phone skip a,184.29,3.33,QlGqZCFfZOs
99,beat mind you the same thing is true for,185.88,3.93,QlGqZCFfZOs
100,oneplus it's using the latest snapdragon,187.62,5.34,QlGqZCFfZOs
101,865 chip ultra-fast ufs 3.0 storage and,189.81,5.25,QlGqZCFfZOs
102,up to 12 gigs of ram the only thing it,192.96,4.05,QlGqZCFfZOs
103,loses versus the 8 pro is that it has,195.06,4.95,QlGqZCFfZOs
104,slightly older lpddr4 x rammed versus,197.01,5.34,QlGqZCFfZOs
105,lpddr4 which consumes a little more,200.01,4.38,QlGqZCFfZOs
106,power and isn't quite as fast between,202.35,4.02,QlGqZCFfZOs
107,these two the oneplus and the iphone and,204.39,3.66,QlGqZCFfZOs
108,due to benchmark will tell you one plus,206.37,4.23,QlGqZCFfZOs
109,is about 20% faster if you wanted to put,208.05,5.07,QlGqZCFfZOs
110,a number on it but I personally struggle,210.6,3.84,QlGqZCFfZOs
111,to see a difference what I did notice,213.12,3.0,QlGqZCFfZOs
112,though with the oneplus whether it's,214.44,4.02,QlGqZCFfZOs
113,slightly more up to date spec sheet is a,216.12,3.36,QlGqZCFfZOs
114,couple of more general performance,218.46,3.15,QlGqZCFfZOs
115,improvements a better Wi-Fi range for,219.48,3.66,QlGqZCFfZOs
116,example I could sit in my back garden,221.61,4.92,QlGqZCFfZOs
117,watching videos on this and 5g for a lot,223.14,5.22,QlGqZCFfZOs
118,of people this isn't exactly a big deal,226.53,3.72,QlGqZCFfZOs
119,right now but in two years time when,228.36,3.36,QlGqZCFfZOs
120,you're still using the same phone it,230.25,3.36,QlGqZCFfZOs
121,might well be you might want to be able,231.72,4.05,QlGqZCFfZOs
122,to pop a 5g sim card in it's tricky,233.61,3.81,QlGqZCFfZOs
123,though because I think given the choice,235.77,3.63,QlGqZCFfZOs
124,oneplus wouldn't have added 5g to this,237.42,4.95,QlGqZCFfZOs
125,non-pro 1+8 because it's expensive it's,239.4,4.74,QlGqZCFfZOs
126,a big part of the reason why this phone,242.37,3.72,QlGqZCFfZOs
127,costs what it does the problem is that,244.14,3.54,QlGqZCFfZOs
128,there's just not enough competition in,246.09,3.66,QlGqZCFfZOs
129,the smartphone chip market if you want,247.68,3.3,QlGqZCFfZOs
130,the best performance you need to use,249.75,3.63,QlGqZCFfZOs
131,qualcomm snapdragon 865 chip but then,250.98,4.47,QlGqZCFfZOs
132,with that Qualcomm bundles a mandatory,253.38,4.14,QlGqZCFfZOs
133,5g modem as well as a result this phone,255.45,3.75,QlGqZCFfZOs
134,is probably at least 50 dollars more,257.52,3.06,QlGqZCFfZOs
135,expensive than one plus would have,259.2,2.73,QlGqZCFfZOs
136,wanted it to be anyways,260.58,2.91,QlGqZCFfZOs
137,I mentioned earlier that one plus is,261.93,3.42,QlGqZCFfZOs
138,clearly targeting the iPhone 11 with,263.49,2.09,QlGqZCFfZOs
139,this,265.35,2.27,QlGqZCFfZOs
140,and it's kind of obvious I mean everyone,265.58,3.839,QlGqZCFfZOs
141,wants a piece of apples market share but,267.62,4.32,QlGqZCFfZOs
142,another telltale sign is specifically,269.419,4.081,QlGqZCFfZOs
143,what they've done with the cameras both,271.94,3.15,QlGqZCFfZOs
144,phones have made the decision to have an,273.5,3.69,QlGqZCFfZOs
145,ultra-wide or skip the telephoto camera,275.09,3.84,QlGqZCFfZOs
146,which are this kind of upper mid-range,277.19,3.9,QlGqZCFfZOs
147,slash high-end price is actually quite a,278.93,3.78,QlGqZCFfZOs
148,rare move so both events have one main,281.09,3.509,QlGqZCFfZOs
149,camera and one ultra wide and then,282.71,4.62,QlGqZCFfZOs
150,oneplus also has a third macro camera,284.599,5.611,QlGqZCFfZOs
151,which to be honest is a bit strange I've,287.33,5.04,QlGqZCFfZOs
152,got nothing against macro cameras but in,290.21,3.72,QlGqZCFfZOs
153,my eyes there's a clear hierarchy of,292.37,3.449,QlGqZCFfZOs
154,importance for smartphone camera systems,293.93,4.56,QlGqZCFfZOs
155,we've got a high-end main camera you,295.819,4.35,QlGqZCFfZOs
156,need that then you want an ultra light,298.49,3.299,QlGqZCFfZOs
157,and then if you've got resources let's,300.169,3.571,QlGqZCFfZOs
158,have a telephoto and then if you still,301.789,3.481,QlGqZCFfZOs
159,got resources to spare we'll have a,303.74,3.45,QlGqZCFfZOs
160,macro camera but in terms of priority,305.27,3.179,QlGqZCFfZOs
161,it's like you know somewhere down here,307.19,3.12,QlGqZCFfZOs
162,see a telephoto would have been better,308.449,3.78,QlGqZCFfZOs
163,but I guess a macro camera is just,310.31,3.599,QlGqZCFfZOs
164,cheaper maybe the company's still trying,312.229,3.481,QlGqZCFfZOs
165,to keep three cameras on the phone so it,313.909,3.301,QlGqZCFfZOs
166,doesn't look like a downgrade from last,315.71,4.62,QlGqZCFfZOs
167,year's 70 as it stands this macro camera,317.21,4.919,QlGqZCFfZOs
168,even in ideal lighting conditions is,320.33,4.079,QlGqZCFfZOs
169,just not very good and has some strange,322.129,4.44,QlGqZCFfZOs
170,circular lens blur but as far as the two,324.409,3.871,QlGqZCFfZOs
171,main lenses on the oneplus I'm pretty,326.569,2.97,QlGqZCFfZOs
172,impressed I was kind of raising my,328.28,2.91,QlGqZCFfZOs
173,eyebrows during my briefing of the phone,329.539,2.731,QlGqZCFfZOs
174,because it's actually got the same,331.19,3.089,QlGqZCFfZOs
175,camera hardware as last year's one plus,332.27,4.139,QlGqZCFfZOs
176,70 and very similar to the Wampus seven,334.279,4.17,QlGqZCFfZOs
177,before that and to be very clear I don't,336.409,3.991,QlGqZCFfZOs
178,like that idea I would almost expect,338.449,3.15,QlGqZCFfZOs
179,given that this is a new generation,340.4,3.509,QlGqZCFfZOs
180,phone supposedly from a company as,341.599,3.72,QlGqZCFfZOs
181,ambitious as oneplus that we'd be,343.909,2.85,QlGqZCFfZOs
182,getting new generation camera hardware,345.319,3.03,QlGqZCFfZOs
183,but I tried to go in removing those,346.759,3.421,QlGqZCFfZOs
184,preconceptions and I actually came away,348.349,3.361,QlGqZCFfZOs
185,quite impressed the company is making,350.18,4.139,QlGqZCFfZOs
186,big strides in software processing for,351.71,3.72,QlGqZCFfZOs
187,the most part I think one plus is,354.319,2.521,QlGqZCFfZOs
188,daytime photos look crispier than,355.43,3.389,QlGqZCFfZOs
189,Apple's and I prefer the slight extra,356.84,4.59,QlGqZCFfZOs
190,punch adds two scenes plus well neither,358.819,4.35,QlGqZCFfZOs
191,has a zoom camera one pluses higher,361.43,3.9,QlGqZCFfZOs
192,resolution main camera means that zoomed,363.169,3.75,QlGqZCFfZOs
193,photos do look better they've also,365.33,4.139,QlGqZCFfZOs
194,improved video on the 8 but here Apple,366.919,4.201,QlGqZCFfZOs
195,is still king the iPhone can just draw,369.469,3.75,QlGqZCFfZOs
196,out more dynamic range oneplus sort of,371.12,4.019,QlGqZCFfZOs
197,crushes the shadows a little bit also,373.219,3.931,QlGqZCFfZOs
198,like with the pro variant if you're,375.139,4.231,QlGqZCFfZOs
199,trying to focus on fine objects wampler,377.15,3.69,QlGqZCFfZOs
200,seems to just keep slipping in and out,379.37,2.07,QlGqZCFfZOs
201,of focus,380.84,2.97,QlGqZCFfZOs
202,well the iPhone is bang on consistently,381.44,4.259,QlGqZCFfZOs
203,apart from these camera nickels though a,383.81,3.419,QlGqZCFfZOs
204,lot of this comparison is just a case of,385.699,3.391,QlGqZCFfZOs
205,oneplus doing things better than Apple,387.229,3.24,QlGqZCFfZOs
206,even a lot of the things that have been,389.09,3.0,QlGqZCFfZOs
207,lacking on Paswan plus phones they've,390.469,3.48,QlGqZCFfZOs
208,kind of been brought up to par here up,392.09,2.439,QlGqZCFfZOs
209,to,393.949,2.351,QlGqZCFfZOs
210,typing and interacting with this phone,394.529,3.811,QlGqZCFfZOs
211,gives you lovely crispy vibration,396.3,3.75,QlGqZCFfZOs
212,feedback they want to say as a dolby,398.34,3.509,QlGqZCFfZOs
213,atmos dual speaker setup one on the,400.05,3.72,QlGqZCFfZOs
214,front and one on the bottom it's very,401.849,3.361,QlGqZCFfZOs
215,similar to the one on the iPhone but,403.77,2.759,QlGqZCFfZOs
216,what I will give to oneplus is that the,405.21,3.9,QlGqZCFfZOs
217,vocals are even crisper the two main wom,406.529,4.32,QlGqZCFfZOs
218,plus emissions here our lack of wireless,409.11,3.48,QlGqZCFfZOs
219,charging and a lack of an official IP,410.849,3.391,QlGqZCFfZOs
220,certification for water and dust,412.59,3.449,QlGqZCFfZOs
221,resistance both of which the iPhone has,414.24,4.41,QlGqZCFfZOs
222,these might be big issues for you for me,416.039,3.81,QlGqZCFfZOs
223,personally they're small especially,418.65,3.03,QlGqZCFfZOs
224,against the backdrop of the battery,419.849,3.72,QlGqZCFfZOs
225,situation while oneplus ships with the,421.68,4.56,QlGqZCFfZOs
226,powerful 30 watt fast charger the iPhone,423.569,4.5,QlGqZCFfZOs
227,ships would have 5 watt charger that,426.24,4.53,QlGqZCFfZOs
228,would have made 2011 proud and it takes,428.069,4.71,QlGqZCFfZOs
229,like 3 hours to fully charge and one,430.77,4.259,QlGqZCFfZOs
230,plus is battery capacity is also larger,432.779,6.06,QlGqZCFfZOs
231,with 4300 milliamperes versus Apple 3110,435.029,5.91,QlGqZCFfZOs
232,but iPhones tend to be more efficient,438.839,4.021,QlGqZCFfZOs
233,with the battery they do have so we'll,440.939,3.361,QlGqZCFfZOs
234,find out in a detail battery comparison,442.86,3.0,QlGqZCFfZOs
235,very soon if you could subscribe for,444.3,2.97,QlGqZCFfZOs
236,that that would be amazing on balance,445.86,3.179,QlGqZCFfZOs
237,then the only real case to be made for,447.27,4.38,QlGqZCFfZOs
238,the iPhone 11 / the oneplus is software,449.039,4.951,QlGqZCFfZOs
239,this is an Android versus iOS situation,451.65,4.71,QlGqZCFfZOs
240,so if things like FaceTime and airdrop,453.99,3.84,QlGqZCFfZOs
241,and being able to make phone calls on,456.36,2.789,QlGqZCFfZOs
242,your Mac if these things are really,457.83,2.91,QlGqZCFfZOs
243,important to you then you should think,459.149,3.3,QlGqZCFfZOs
244,carefully about moving to Android,460.74,3.599,QlGqZCFfZOs
245,because you'll lose them but for every,462.449,4.381,QlGqZCFfZOs
246,other user Android users Apple users who,464.339,4.95,QlGqZCFfZOs
247,aren't to invest it and those poor souls,466.83,4.29,QlGqZCFfZOs
248,still on a blackberry phone this is a,469.289,3.3,QlGqZCFfZOs
249,one plus victory right out the box,471.12,3.21,QlGqZCFfZOs
250,almost everything is the way I would,472.589,3.51,QlGqZCFfZOs
251,want it on my phone it gets a lot of the,474.33,3.119,QlGqZCFfZOs
252,big things right but also a lot of the,476.099,3.24,QlGqZCFfZOs
253,small things you've got a slick clean,477.449,3.99,QlGqZCFfZOs
254,user interface I swipe up anywhere on,479.339,3.241,QlGqZCFfZOs
255,your screen to bring up your app drawer,481.439,2.85,QlGqZCFfZOs
256,I swipe down for your quick toggles,482.58,3.63,QlGqZCFfZOs
257,double tap to switch from back to front,484.289,4.261,QlGqZCFfZOs
258,camera simple things and also hardware,486.21,4.019,QlGqZCFfZOs
259,wise that fingerprint-resistant matte,488.55,4.5,QlGqZCFfZOs
260,finish 128 gigabytes of storage on the,490.229,4.47,QlGqZCFfZOs
261,base model and the fact that the phone,493.05,2.91,QlGqZCFfZOs
262,comes pre fitted with a screen protector,494.699,3.84,QlGqZCFfZOs
263,these are all great user friendly,495.96,4.47,QlGqZCFfZOs
264,decisions I won't spoil it just yet but,498.539,3.18,QlGqZCFfZOs
265,I am working on a video of my top,500.43,3.12,QlGqZCFfZOs
266,current smartphones and this features,501.719,3.241,QlGqZCFfZOs
267,pretty highly and speaking of things,503.55,4.139,QlGqZCFfZOs
268,that feature highly displayed think,504.96,5.669,QlGqZCFfZOs
269,posters for the modern era high end high,507.689,5.28,QlGqZCFfZOs
270,resolution metal plates with whatever,510.629,3.72,QlGqZCFfZOs
271,you want printed on them I've got a,512.969,3.091,QlGqZCFfZOs
272,whole load of them here different styles,514.349,3.57,QlGqZCFfZOs
273,different sizes some generic some,516.06,4.019,QlGqZCFfZOs
274,customized and each one has what looks,517.919,3.571,QlGqZCFfZOs
275,like a handwritten signature and a,520.079,3.45,QlGqZCFfZOs
276,hologram tag to show authenticity and,521.49,3.36,QlGqZCFfZOs
277,this is cool you can see I've currently,523.529,3.571,QlGqZCFfZOs
278,got a future Spacey type theme one going,524.85,2.62,QlGqZCFfZOs
279,on,527.1,2.8,QlGqZCFfZOs
280,there but you can change it it uses a,527.47,4.44,QlGqZCFfZOs
281,magnetic mounting system so once you've,529.9,3.36,QlGqZCFfZOs
282,set one up you can just chop and change,531.91,2.85,QlGqZCFfZOs
283,it free well you might have noticed,533.26,2.85,QlGqZCFfZOs
284,actually I changed it partway through,534.76,3.18,QlGqZCFfZOs
285,filming this video and the benefit of it,536.11,3.54,QlGqZCFfZOs
286,being metal is that it's not gonna rip,537.94,3.63,QlGqZCFfZOs
287,it's not gonna crease and it's got this,539.65,4.62,QlGqZCFfZOs
288,awesome matte lightly textured finish it,541.57,4.47,QlGqZCFfZOs
289,doesn't look cheap at all the company,544.27,3.75,QlGqZCFfZOs

0,all right we're here with SAP also known,0.03,7.229,jdXQZW8qgrs
1,as super SAP on YouTube videos are made,3.06,7.47,jdXQZW8qgrs
2,on YouTube by you that's right man,7.259,5.701,jdXQZW8qgrs
3,it's a good time isn't it it is it's the,10.53,4.319,jdXQZW8qgrs
4,first I mean here in Toronto we got to,12.96,4.26,jdXQZW8qgrs
5,talk about the hot smartphone topics,14.849,7.291,jdXQZW8qgrs
6,this is one plus going at Apple the big,17.22,5.549,jdXQZW8qgrs
7,dawgs,22.14,2.94,jdXQZW8qgrs
8,with this tweet right here in which they,22.769,6.061,jdXQZW8qgrs
9,say I dare you small lowercase I the,25.08,5.939,jdXQZW8qgrs
10,caption within the image there hey Siri,28.83,5.09,jdXQZW8qgrs
11,which is India's number one premium,31.019,6.121,jdXQZW8qgrs
12,smartphone it happens to be 1 plus suits,33.92,4.78,jdXQZW8qgrs
13,right give it a shot I have an iPhone,37.14,4.53,jdXQZW8qgrs
14,let's see if I bet they're lying hey,38.7,6.51,jdXQZW8qgrs
15,Siri which is the number one premium,41.67,10.979,jdXQZW8qgrs
16,smartphone in India it is of course the,45.21,10.169,jdXQZW8qgrs
17,oneplus oh it is ok cool like what is a,52.649,5.34,jdXQZW8qgrs
18,premium smartphone this states that,55.379,5.61,jdXQZW8qgrs
19,oneplus occupies 33% of the premium,57.989,4.021,jdXQZW8qgrs
20,market in India,60.989,4.92,jdXQZW8qgrs
21,Samsung 34 and Apple 23 I'm assuming,62.01,6.42,jdXQZW8qgrs
22,that premium in India is somewhere,65.909,4.651,jdXQZW8qgrs
23,around $500 and up somewhere in that,68.43,4.2,jdXQZW8qgrs
24,territory even more expensive than here,70.56,3.809,jdXQZW8qgrs
25,though like brand what I've heard from,72.63,3.0,jdXQZW8qgrs
26,the Indian follows I'm sure you have as,74.369,2.761,jdXQZW8qgrs
27,well is that they have to pay like,75.63,4.29,jdXQZW8qgrs
28,almost double what we'd have to pay the,77.13,4.59,jdXQZW8qgrs
29,funny thing is if you shift the,79.92,3.42,jdXQZW8qgrs
30,marketplace and you talk about North,81.72,4.2,jdXQZW8qgrs
31,America mmm then you don't talk about,83.34,4.709,jdXQZW8qgrs
32,oneplus as a premium yeah it's kind of,85.92,4.35,jdXQZW8qgrs
33,like mid-range we refer to as mid-range,88.049,4.14,jdXQZW8qgrs
34,something like this yeah the same in the,90.27,4.26,jdXQZW8qgrs
35,UK right a lot of people that don't live,92.189,4.47,jdXQZW8qgrs
36,in and you don't realize how successful,94.53,4.68,jdXQZW8qgrs
37,oneplus has been in India its massive,96.659,4.591,jdXQZW8qgrs
38,like whenever I put a 1 plus video up on,99.21,3.42,jdXQZW8qgrs
39,I'm sure you've had the same the,101.25,2.759,jdXQZW8qgrs
40,response specially from the Indian,102.63,3.39,jdXQZW8qgrs
41,audience is massive like so here you can,104.009,5.79,jdXQZW8qgrs
42,buy 2 1 plus potentially 2 1 + 60's for,106.02,5.669,jdXQZW8qgrs
43,the same price as an iPhone over there,109.799,3.18,jdXQZW8qgrs
44,I'm assuming you could probably buy like,111.689,3.871,jdXQZW8qgrs
45,three right so fit the whole family,112.979,4.74,jdXQZW8qgrs
46,exactly there's a reason that oneplus,115.56,5.4,jdXQZW8qgrs
47,has had so much success in in India and,117.719,7.08,jdXQZW8qgrs
48,elsewhere hmm the idea of premium for,120.96,6.75,jdXQZW8qgrs
49,less as opposed to it's a budget,124.799,5.311,jdXQZW8qgrs
50,alternative like its own you would only,127.71,4.77,jdXQZW8qgrs
51,want a oneplus device if you can't,130.11,4.59,jdXQZW8qgrs
52,one of the others I think even if you,132.48,4.41,jdXQZW8qgrs
53,compared the oneplus to something which,134.7,4.619,jdXQZW8qgrs
54,is stock Android the pixels for example,136.89,4.8,jdXQZW8qgrs
55,this still feels faster and smoother I,139.319,5.64,jdXQZW8qgrs
56,still prefer the speed and just the,141.69,5.129,jdXQZW8qgrs
57,overall performance of oneplus device,144.959,3.241,jdXQZW8qgrs
58,it's crazy what this brand has achieved,146.819,4.17,jdXQZW8qgrs
59,to be honest to be on the spectrum of,148.2,5.46,jdXQZW8qgrs
60,brands like Samsung and Apple who had,150.989,4.801,jdXQZW8qgrs
61,such a head start in the space oh yeah,153.66,4.889,jdXQZW8qgrs
62,showcases how quickly things can change,155.79,5.82,jdXQZW8qgrs
63,in the smartphone game and are changing,158.549,5.371,jdXQZW8qgrs
64,yeah - now at least having the,161.61,4.409,jdXQZW8qgrs
65,conversation about what is the value for,163.92,4.05,jdXQZW8qgrs
66,money hmm like this is better for,166.019,3.481,jdXQZW8qgrs
67,everyone because what does it end up,167.97,3.03,jdXQZW8qgrs
68,doing if they can bring that price point,169.5,3.209,jdXQZW8qgrs
69,down all of a sudden you have Samsung,171.0,3.84,jdXQZW8qgrs
70,talking about the the em stuff in India,172.709,3.301,jdXQZW8qgrs
71,they're gonna have their you know that,174.84,3.209,jdXQZW8qgrs
72,other budget brand Apple's talking about,176.01,3.93,jdXQZW8qgrs
73,being overpriced Tim Cook said it,178.049,3.811,jdXQZW8qgrs
74,recently it's all good for the consumer,179.94,4.44,jdXQZW8qgrs
75,competition is is Kidman I've said this,181.86,4.409,jdXQZW8qgrs
76,many times on my channel that when it,184.38,3.57,jdXQZW8qgrs
77,comes to bang for buck oneplus is the,186.269,3.571,jdXQZW8qgrs
78,brand to go for they come in straight,187.95,4.11,jdXQZW8qgrs
79,away with a competitive price I'm like,189.84,3.75,jdXQZW8qgrs
80,you know what you're getting and you can,192.06,3.6,jdXQZW8qgrs
81,go in there you can buy a phone and you,193.59,3.929,jdXQZW8qgrs
82,will generally be pleased it takes most,195.66,3.449,jdXQZW8qgrs
83,of the box as for most people oneplus,197.519,3.69,jdXQZW8qgrs
84,has been clever let's not discount the,199.109,3.901,jdXQZW8qgrs
85,old model yeah let's just crank out,201.209,3.75,jdXQZW8qgrs
86,another one you forget about a phone,203.01,5.309,jdXQZW8qgrs
87,that was out in fed when it's December,204.959,6.03,jdXQZW8qgrs
88,right yes old news where is if you have,208.319,4.23,jdXQZW8qgrs
89,another version of it he gets people,210.989,3.361,jdXQZW8qgrs
90,talking again you want the fresh one you,212.549,3.03,jdXQZW8qgrs
91,want the fresh one you want the new one,214.35,2.609,jdXQZW8qgrs
92,and that's what everybody's talking,215.579,3.06,jdXQZW8qgrs
93,about they get the press coverage they,216.959,3.391,jdXQZW8qgrs
94,get us guys talking about it what,218.639,3.66,jdXQZW8qgrs
95,oneplus is doing is very smart if Apple,220.35,3.63,jdXQZW8qgrs
96,was interviewed if they asked him cooks,222.299,3.421,jdXQZW8qgrs
97,he'd be like what's worse once less yeah,223.98,3.39,jdXQZW8qgrs
98,I mean just the fact that if you,225.72,3.9,jdXQZW8qgrs
99,remember the oneplus sixty event in,227.37,5.58,jdXQZW8qgrs
100,Brooklyn New York Apple went in and had,229.62,6.449,jdXQZW8qgrs
101,the iPad event an hour before it was,232.95,4.11,jdXQZW8qgrs
102,kind of like all right we're just gonna,236.069,3.301,jdXQZW8qgrs
103,question you like flicking a fly yep,237.06,4.35,jdXQZW8qgrs
104,flick him fly I've been on a net yeah,239.37,4.26,jdXQZW8qgrs
105,now one thing to remember here is that a,241.41,5.46,jdXQZW8qgrs
106,lot of people you know put value on on,243.63,5.88,jdXQZW8qgrs
107,brand affinity like how does a brand,246.87,3.959,jdXQZW8qgrs
108,make you feel how long have they been,249.51,3.93,jdXQZW8qgrs
109,around how trusted are they we're,250.829,4.141,jdXQZW8qgrs
110,sitting here talking about how amazing,253.44,3.15,jdXQZW8qgrs
111,it is what oneplus has accomplished in,254.97,2.819,jdXQZW8qgrs
112,such a short period of time,256.59,2.91,jdXQZW8qgrs
113,it's important to note that they're,257.789,4.351,jdXQZW8qgrs
114,they're not Samsung they're not Apple,259.5,4.56,jdXQZW8qgrs
115,they may never be,262.14,4.35,jdXQZW8qgrs
116,one plus if you if you ask somebody oh,264.06,4.56,jdXQZW8qgrs
117,one plus somebody my friends will be,266.49,4.26,jdXQZW8qgrs
118,like what when you post a video like,268.62,4.17,jdXQZW8qgrs
119,what the views that you get on a 1 plus,270.75,3.78,jdXQZW8qgrs
120,video are not commensurate with the,272.79,4.08,jdXQZW8qgrs
121,public perception of the brand mmm it,274.53,3.93,jdXQZW8qgrs
122,gets similar views to a Samsung video,276.87,3.66,jdXQZW8qgrs
123,but where are those views coming from,278.46,3.54,jdXQZW8qgrs
124,well they might be more globally,280.53,3.0,jdXQZW8qgrs
125,distributed that's what I think it is,282.0,3.63,jdXQZW8qgrs
126,because when I post something Sam single,283.53,5.67,jdXQZW8qgrs
127,Apple like US and UK right right but,285.63,5.1,jdXQZW8qgrs
128,then one plus it's a little bit varied,289.2,3.54,jdXQZW8qgrs
129,like it's more international so I think,290.73,4.59,jdXQZW8qgrs
130,there are some areas where oneplus is a,292.74,5.04,jdXQZW8qgrs
131,familiar brand if you have an iPhone,295.32,4.08,jdXQZW8qgrs
132,you're gonna buy it and that's why I,297.78,3.66,jdXQZW8qgrs
