text = "So i got this phone by an invite and i have to say it is one killer phone specially for the price. its only 250$ which came out to be 266$ and somethings cents being that i live in CA in the US. anyways let me mentions my experience with this phone after a week\n-The Good (not just good, amazing)-\n-the screen is a killer being that its amoled\n-->you get deep blacks and rich colors.. although its 1080p its still good and at ~400ppi, you won't notice any pixels at a good distace\n-processor is still snappy even tho its 2 yrs old, snapdragon 801 ftw!!\n--> yes its the same processor used 2 yrs ago on flagships 2013 phones, i used to have a nexus 5 and it has the same performance, may notice one lag here and there but its barely noticeable\n-close to .. or stock android? either way your getting close to a full android experience, that being said, its snappy\n--> no manufacture bloatware, it also has oxygen os which is just amazing specially the customization with gestures which should actually be in all android phones. no 6.0 update yet but 5.1.1 is still keeper\n-build quality is spectacular but too bad it has glass front and back so i just used the included case bec. im scared to drop my phone. p\n--> it also has a built in screen protector, keep in mind that around the edges theres a slight bevel so be cautions in buying a screen protector because i bet most manufacturers will just fit the whole screen without taking into account the slight bevel on the edges which will rise the screen protector, thus is useless.\n-speakers i think is a 3.5/5, im not an audiophile but yes the speakers are good for most people who just want to watch a vid and don't care much of audio, it does distort on high levels but not all the time.\n-NOW** to keep in mind-\n-LTE support, hope i can help many of you guys concerning the network issues\n--> this phone has LTE bands 1/2/4/5/7/8 .. now yes as you have probly read everywhere LTE is limited in the US especially when your on ATT and T-mobile because its missing bands 12 and 17.. which are the main bands of the 2 carriers. ATT heavily uses band 17 **so i can tell you right now, if you want this phone and you use att, DONT GET IT.. limited LTE support, watch pocketnows video on youtube where they are currently on att and theres limited coverage. do not get it, you won't like it unless you can deal with hspa+ and 3G, good luck\nBUT!!! IF YOUR ON T-MOBILE, which i currently have, Get This Phone **UNLESS you live in a rural area (but pls do still check coverage if your covered, best coverage is the citys, preferebly not inside buildings. IF YOUR CURRENTLY A TMOBILE OR ATT CUSTOMER DOWNLOAD 'LTE DISCOVERY' to check what lte band your using. then make the decisions yourself. but anyways, my experience with this device on tmobile is spectacular because i get lte everywhere. BUT KEEP IN MIND, tmobile is upgrading to band 12, they already did but its not in all cities,  and that being said you won't get lte band 12 support if they do but hey, as long as your gertting lte on your phone everywhere you go its still a keeper. i used LTE Discovery and checked everywhere i went and tmobile mainly USES BAND 4 WHICH THE ONEPLUS X HAS!!!! yay, i had great connection on my nexus 5 too, lte everywhere and it didn't even have band 12.\n===conclusion for the networks: get it if your on tmobile and DO NOT get if your on att, just keep in mind you won't get band 12 if tmobile upgrades to it BUT as long as you get good lte on your old phone and its not using band 12 then get it\n-call quality is great as always and everyday is use without notice of lag in typical tasks.\n--> playing games, somewhat frame drops but intensive games, lower the graphics, but yes its definitly playable\n-oh and yes battery life, ~2500 mah which is more than good for me, may be different for some people tho\n--> i get a whole day from this thing from ~4 hrs on time with just typically watching vids, searching stuff on amazon, fb and ig, so ya typical use. it will get you passed a day but if your a heavy user tone down on use or just carry an external battery charger thingy. standby time is great too\n-now onto camera, which is great not amazing i would still prefer my nexus 5 for video because of the one plus x's lack of video stabilization, which isn't a biggie but there was definitly less shaking on the Nexus 5 but its not that big of a difference\n--> photo quality is great again not amazing and is definitly good for point and shoot but professional use.. 2/5 but its alright, slow motion is like toned down quality it shoots it on 720p but looks eh and you can't adjust where the slow mo parts are which is a biggie for me bec. i sk8, timelapse mode is cool and works great, video quality is good but ya no vid stabilization and zooming in the video gets bad quality.. imagine starting at 1080p then zooming in you go down to like 480p.. but is acceptable, i havnt tried the panorama but prety sure its coo\n--THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND\n-no nfc, which isn't a biggie for me being that i don't use any of its features, well like once a month but ya\n-no quickcharge, maybe a big deal for some but not much for me, just carry and external battery charger but i understand its kinda an issue\n-dont drop it, glass front and back yup be careful\nMICRO SD SLOT FTW, if your having problems with the phone not recognizing it just go to the storage settings and enable storage OTG or something like that.. MAKE SURE you updated oxygen os to the latest one because before the update the phone couldn't recognize them for some reason.\n<Final Words> (i live in CA in the US so ya)\n-get it if your on tmobile and your in an area with LTE bands 1/2/4/5/7/8 don't get it if your on 12, and check coverage for rural area if you live there. and um ya i don't recomend it on att .... and um for the people outside of US, check your coverage and stuff\n-and finally if you don't use stuff like nfc, quickcharge, don't mind a not bad not amazing camera then its a keeper\n*go on oneplus' website and check the phones info bec i probly forgot stuff haha\n-btw who wrote this review is my son, just under my account ,which im just in high school haha, so ya this review is from my personal experience and yep its a keeper,\
    gr8 phone but read review *dont rec. if ur on Att bec. lack of band 17 but still good on tmobile even lack of band 12, depends*"
